Called the Centers for Common Disease Genomics (CCDG), this initiative will explore a range of diseases with the ultimate goal of: undertaking variant discovery for enough different examples of disease architectures and study designs to better understand the general principles of the genomic architecture underlying common, complex inherited diseases; understanding how best to design rare variant studies for common disease; developing resources, informatics tools, and innovative approaches and technologies for multiple disease research communities and the wider biomedical research community. The initial focus of the CCDGs will be in cardiovascular disease (early-onset coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, hemorrhagic stroke), neuropsychiatric disease (epilepsy, autism), and autoimmune/inflammatory disease (type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease). The Broad Institute is one of four selected CCDG project centers. The overarching aim of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) program is to define the full allelic spectrum of protein-altering variation in genes associated to IBD, and assess their role in both Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC) risk. The whole genome sequencing data generated here is comprised of samples from US-based diverse populations including African American, Puerto-Rican, Caribean and Cuban origins. \\n</td>\n",

Daly) and a collaborative network of research labs focused on the genetics of autism (brought together by the Autism Genome Project and the Autism Consortium). These groups worked together to utilize dramatic new advances in DNA sequencing technology to reveal the genetic architecture of autism through comprehensive examination of the exotic sequence of all genes. The Autism Sequencing Consortium (ASC) was founded by Joseph D. Buxbaum and colleagues as an international group of scientists who share autism spectrum disorder (ASD) samples and genetic data. The PIs are Drs. Joseph D. Buxbaum (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai), Mark J. Daly (Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard), Bernie Devlin (University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine), Kathryn Roeder (Carnegie Mellon University, Matthew State and Stephan Sanders (University of California, San Francisco). The rationale for the ASC is described in [Buxbaum et al. 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23259942), and this paper should be cited when referencing the data set. All shared data and analysis is hosted at a single site, which enables joint analysis of large-scale data from many groups. The ASC was first supported by a cooperative agreement grant to four lead sites funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (U01MH100233, U01MH100209, U01MH100229, U01MH100239), with additional support from the National Human Genome Research Institute. The NIMH recently renewed their support with a second grant (U01MH111661, U01MH111660, U01MH111658 and U01MH111662) to expand the project from 29,000 genomes to more than 50,000 exomes over the next 5 years. NHGRI provides ongoing sequencing support for the ASD through the Broad Center for Common Disease Genomics (UM1HG008895, Mark Daly, PI).\\n</td>\n",

The primary objective was the implementation of a hereditary cancer risk assessment program in healthy 18-49 year-olds in primary care settings within a vertically integrated health delivery system (Kaiser Permanente) and a federal qualified health center (Denver Health). The investigators aimed to assess clinical exome sequencing implementation and interpretation, as well as tailored interactions for low health literacy including a contextualized consent process, and a modified approach to results disclosure and genetic counseling. The investigators were also assessing the clinical utility (healthcare utilization and adherence to recommended care) and personal utility of primary and additional results from clinical exome sequencing, and evaluate the ethical and policy implications of considering personal utility of genomic information decisions for health care coverage.Sequencing and analysis for CHARM was conducted at the Northwest Clinical Genomics Laboratory, University of Washington, Seattle (&lt;a href=\"https://nwgc.gs.washington.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;https://nwgc.gs.washington.edu/&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;</td>\n",

SouthSeq aims to sequence 600 newborn babies presenting with congenital anomalies, or other signs of a rare genetic disorder. The primary goals of SouthSeq are to provide early diagnoses to children with rare genetic conditions, to demonstrate the utility of genome sequencing as a frontline test with potential to improve intermediate and long-term clinical outcomes, and to equip non-genetics providers to deliver test results in order to facilitate the conduction of genome sequencing outside of major medical centers where patients may not have access to a genetics provider. SouthSeq also aims to ensure that genomic testing is applied across diverse communities; recruitment efforts focus on patients from rural and minority populations that have been historically under-represented in both medicine and genomics research.&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nSequencing and analysis for SouthSeq are being conducted at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology in Huntsville, Alabama ([https://www.hudsonalpha.org/](https://www.hudsonalpha.org/)). Enrollment of infants with signs of genetic disease is approved at five clinical sites, including nurseries at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, the University of Mississippi Medical Center, Woman's Hospital in Baton Rouge, Children's Hospital in New Orleans, and the University of Louisville. Both biological parents are enrolled when available so that follow-up testing can be performed to determine inheritance.

The primary goal of the eMERGE Network is to develop, disseminate, and apply approaches to research that combine biorepositories with electronic medical record (EMR) systems for genomic discovery and genomic medicine implementation research. eMERGE was announced in September 2007 and began its third phase in September 2015. eMERGE III consists of nine study sites, two central sequencing and genotyping facilities, and a coordinating center. eMERGE Phase III aims to: 1) sequence and assess the phenotypic implication of rare variants in a custom designed eMERGEseq panel consisting of 109 genes (including 56 ACMG actionable finding list genes and the top 6 genes from each site relevant to their specific aims), as well as approximately 1400 SNPs; 2) assess the phenotypic implications of these variants by developing, validating and implementing new phenotype algorithms, 3) integrate genetic variants into EMRs to inform clinical care; and 4) create community resources. Included in this study are:  - ~24,000 eMERGE participants from 10 eMERGE III study sites. - Corresponding demographics, body mass index measurements. - Top PheWAS codes generated from a collated list of ICD codes from all study sites.  \\n\\nStudy sites and participants include:\\n\\n**Cincinnati Children&amp;#39;s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC):**&lt;br/&gt; Cincinnati Children&amp;#39;s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) is a not-for-profit hospital and research center pioneering breakthrough treatments, providing outstanding family-centered patient care and training healthcare professionals for the future, and dedicated to improving health and welfare of children and to the shared purpose of discovery and practical application of new genomic information to the ordinary care of children. We bring a comprehensive electronic health record (EPIC), a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 680K patient records, a biobank with &amp;#62;261,000 consents that allow return of results to &amp;#62;84,000 patients and guardians who have provided DNA samples, and hundreds of faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. CCHMC will help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify genes for the eMERGE III targeted sequencing panel, provide 3,000 DNA samples from CCHMC patients to be sequenced, review targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis. We will also extend our work generating phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods to many new childhood diseases. We will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, and develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning sequencing results. \\n\\n**Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP):**&lt;br/&gt; The Center for Applied Genomics (CAG) is a specialized Center of Emphasis at the Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), and one of the world&amp;#39;s largest genetics research programs, with to state-of-the-art high-throughput sequencing and genotyping technology. Our primary goal is to translate basic research findings to medical innovations. We aim to develop new and better ways to diagnose and treat children affected by rare and complex medical disorders, including asthma, autism, epilepsy, pediatric cancer, learning disabilities, and a range of rare diseases.

The study group is 2500 patients recruited from diverse clinics and community outreach centers of self-reported White (~61%), Asian (~11%), African-American (~11%), American Indian/Alaska Native (&amp;#60;1%) racial and Hispanic (~33%) ethnic backgrounds. There are two subgroups in the study cohort - a retrospective group (N=1052) that includes patients from oncology and nephrology clinics, and a prospective one (N=1448) that includes healthy individuals as well as participants with diverse medical conditions. Confirmed pathogenic variants in 70 selected genes will be returned to participants and their healthcare providers through the EHR integration. Participants are able to choose the results they receive and will have the freedom to meet with a genetic counselor and a geneticist to review results. The impact of genetic testing on clinical care is determined by periodic monitoring of EHRs.\\n\\n**Geisinger:**&lt;br/&gt; Samples and phenotype data in this study were provided by the Geisinger MyCode&amp;#174; Community Health Initiative.

NWIGM is based at the University of Washington and co-managed by the University of Washington and KPWA. The purpose of the NWIGM biorepository is to build infrastructure and resources to carry out a broad range of future genetic research. KPWA members enrolled in the biorepository are asked to provide informed consent to providing a DNA sample for storage in the NWIGM biorepository. The consent is purposefully broad to serve the dual purpose of reducing the burden on researchers who wish to use this biorepository and the IRB committees who will be responsible for reviewing these requests in the future. Participants were eligible if aged 50 - 65 years old at the time of their enrollment into the NWIGM repository, living, enrolled in KPWA&amp;#39;s integrated group practice, and had completed an online Health Risk Appraisal. The selection algorithm was based on several data sources from the EHR at KPWA. 1) Demographics - participants with self-reported race as Asian ancestry were prioritized and selected to enrich for non-European ancestry. The KPWA eMERGE cohort includes N=1,245 members of Asian ancestry. 2) Participants were also selected for a history of colorectal cancer (N=1,255), in order to allow us to enrich germline pathogenic variants. \\n\\n**Mayo Clinic:**&lt;br/&gt; The Return of Actionable Variants Empirical (RAVE) Study was approved by the Mayo Clinic IRB. We recruited 2537 participants from Mayo Clinic biobanks in Rochester, MN, who had hypercholesterolemia or colon polyps, thereby enriching for Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and monogenic causes of colorectal cancer (CRC). Additional eligibility criteria were: 1) residents of Southeast MN who were alive and aged 18-70 years; 2) LDL-C level &amp;#62;155 or &amp;#62;120 mg/dl while on lipid-lowering therapy; 3) no known cause of secondary hyperlipidemia; and 4) no cognitive impairment or dementia that would compromise their ability to give written informed consent. Based on these criteria, we identified 5270 eligible patients and obtained informed consent from 3030 participants. Recruitment was conducted in waves and utilized mailed recruitment packets consisting of a study brochure, a written informed consent form, a baseline psychosocial questionnaire, and a return postage-paid envelope. DNA of 2537 participants was sent for CLIA-certified targeted sequencing of 109 genes including genes associated with FH and CRC. Targeted sequencing and genotyping was performed in a Central Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA)-certified laboratory.\\n\\n**Northwestern University:**&lt;br/&gt; Samples and data used in this study were obtained from patients from Northwestern Medicine, an integrated healthcare system, formed through a partnership of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare and Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Participants include a retrospective cohort from the Northwestern Pharmacogenomics Study, funded through the eMERGE II project, NHGRI (3U01HG006388-02S1) and a prospective cohort from the Genetic Testing and Your Health Study, funded through the eMERGE III project, NHGRI (U01HG008673). Patients were eligible to participate if they were18 years or older and see a physician at Northwestern Medicine. Patients consented to genetic testing and to allow their results to be placed in their electronic medical record.\\n\\n**Vanderbilt University Medical Center:**&lt;br/&gt; Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) participants were enrolled in the eMERGE Network through the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records (VGER) project. Patients were provided the appropriate consent to receive clinically relevant genetic results (N=2,700). Participants were eligible if aged 21 or over, had a healthcare provider at VUMC, and visited the provider at least 3 times in the past 3 years. \\n\\n**Meharry Medical College:**&lt;br/&gt; Inclusion of ethnic groups in genomic research is critical to identify possible reasons for health disparities. African-Americans are being enrolled in various outpatient clinics of Nashville General Hospital at Meharry, an inner city hospital primary serving a poorer patient group. A total of 500 African Americans with four cancer types demonstrating health disparities in this population - prostate, colon, breast, lung are identified and approached by clinical research coordinators. The purpose of the study is to determine if any genetic information can be identified from these patients who have or are at high risk of one of these disparate cancers. All participants provide written informed consent and HIPAA authorization to provide blood samples for broad research use and permission to access data in their hospital electronic medical record for research now and in the future. An extensive demographic profile is obtained and entered into a REDCap database. Blood samples are obtained for a panel of alleles from extracted DNA at Baylor. In addition, de-identified coded samples are processed and stored in a central biorepository for further DNA, RNA and proteomic analyses. The survey and phlebotomy are performed at the time of the initial contact and agreement to participate. Nearly all patients approached willingly agree to participate for potential benefit to themselves, family members, or humankind. Little concern is voiced of providing samples for genetic analysis. Study investigators will share results with the participants and providers if testing does not indicate high risk. Results indicating increased risk or actionable alleles for the patient and/or family will be returned by a genetic counselor. Monitoring of the patients&amp;#39; health in this cohort will continue to be followed in the EMR to identify any future associations that might explain health disparities in African Americans. Proposals will be reviewed from investigators to study the genetic or proteomic samples as well as the clinical and demographic information in the repository.\\n\\nPlease note that this version of the dataset has a handful of mismatches between genotyped and provided sex.

       "      <td>\\nThe Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network is a National Institutes of Health (NIH)-organized and funded consortium of U.S. medical research institutions. The primary goal of the eMERGE Network is to develop, disseminate, and apply approaches to research that combine biorepositories with electronic medical record (EMR) systems for genomic discovery and genomic medicine implementation research. eMERGE was announced in September 2007 and began its third phase in September 2015. eMERGE III consists of nine study sites, two central sequencing and genotyping facilities, and a coordinating center. eMERGE Phase III aims to: 1) sequence and assess the phenotypic implication of rare variants in a custom designed eMERGEseq panel consisting of 109 genes (including 56 ACMG actionable finding list genes and the top 6 genes from each site relevant to their specific aims), as well as approximately 1400 SNPs; 2) assess the phenotypic implications of these variants by developing, validating and implementing new phenotype algorithms, 3) integrate genetic variants into EMRs to inform clinical care; and 4) create community resources. Included in this study are:  - ~24,000 eMERGE participants from 10 eMERGE III study sites. - Corresponding demographics, body mass index measurements. - Top PheWAS codes generated from a collated list of ICD codes from all study sites.  \\n\\nStudy sites and participants include:\\n\\n**Cincinnati Children&amp;#39;s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC):**&lt;br/&gt; Cincinnati Children&amp;#39;s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) is a not-for-profit hospital and research center pioneering breakthrough treatments, providing outstanding family-centered patient care and training healthcare professionals for the future, and dedicated to improving health and welfare of children and to the shared purpose of discovery and practical application of new genomic information to the ordinary care of children. We bring a comprehensive electronic health record (EPIC), a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 680K patient records, a biobank with &amp;#62;261,000 consents that allow return of results to &amp;#62;84,000 patients and guardians who have provided DNA samples, and hundreds of faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. CCHMC will help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify genes for the eMERGE III targeted sequencing panel, provide 3,000 DNA samples from CCHMC patients to be sequenced, review targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis. We will also extend our work generating phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods to many new childhood diseases. We will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, and develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning sequencing results. \\n\\n**Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP):**&lt;br/&gt; The Center for Applied Genomics (CAG) is a specialized Center of Emphasis at the Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), and one of the world&amp;#39;s largest genetics research programs, with to state-of-the-art high-throughput sequencing and genotyping technology. Our primary goal is to translate basic research findings to medical innovations. We aim to develop new and better ways to diagnose and treat children affected by rare and complex medical disorders, including asthma, autism, epilepsy, pediatric cancer, learning disabilities, and a range of rare diseases. Ultimately, our objective is to generate new diagnostic tests and to guide physicians to the most appropriate therapies. Participants were recruited from the CAG biorepository (n&amp;#62;450,000), specifically from &amp;#62;100,000 CHOP pediatric patients and family members, which is enriched for rare-diseases (n&amp;#62;12,000). Center for Applied Genomics, The Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia We gratefully thank all the children and their families who enrolled in this study, and all individuals who donated blood samples for research purposes. Genotyping for this project was performed at the Center for Applied Genomics and supported by an Institutional Development Award from The Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia. Sequencing was supported by the National Institutes of Health through an award from the National Human Genome Research Institute&amp;#39;s Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) program (U01HG008684). \\n\\n**Columbia University:**&lt;br/&gt; The goal of the Columbia eMERGE III project is to develop methods for integrating genomic data in EHRs and to study the impact of such genomic informatics interventions on the health of a diverse, underserved urban adult English- and Spanish-speaking patient population in Northern Manhattan served by Columbia University Medical Center/New York-Presbyterian Hospital system. The study group is 2500 patients recruited from diverse clinics and community outreach centers of self-reported White (~61%), Asian (~11%), African-American (~11%), American Indian/Alaska Native (&amp;#60;1%) racial and Hispanic (~33%) ethnic backgrounds. There are two subgroups in the study cohort - a retrospective group (N=1052) that includes patients from oncology and nephrology clinics, and a prospective one (N=1448) that includes healthy individuals as well as participants with diverse medical conditions. Confirmed pathogenic variants in 70 selected genes will be returned to participants and their healthcare providers through the EHR integration. Participants are able to choose the results they receive and will have the freedom to meet with a genetic counselor and a geneticist to review results. The impact of genetic testing on clinical care is determined by periodic monitoring of EHRs.\\n\\n**Geisinger:**&lt;br/&gt; Samples and phenotype data in this study were provided by the Geisinger MyCode&amp;#174; Community Health Initiative. Participants are recruited across the Geisinger System via online consents or in-person consents at a hospital or clinic visit. Enrollment is ongoing with over 100,000 individuals currently consented.\\n\\n**Partners Healthcare (Harvard University):**&lt;br/&gt; The Partners HealthCare Biobank is a large research program designed to help researchers understand how people&amp;#39;s health is affected by their genes, lifestyle, and environment. This large research data and sample repository provides access to high-quality, consented blood samples to help foster research, advance our understanding of the causes of common diseases, and advance the practice of medicine. For the Partners research community (Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women&amp;#39;s Hospital), the Biobank provides:  - Banked samples (plasma, serum, and DNA) collected from consented patients  - Blood samples that were discarded after clinical testing in the Crimson Cores maintained in the Brigham and Women&amp;#39;s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital Pathology Departments  - Sample handling and preparation services - Link to the biobank data to the Partners Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) a research instance of our electronic clinical chart - Data access through our research portal.  \\n\\nTo date, over 70,000 Partners patients have given their consent to enroll, give a blood sample, receive research results and agreed to be re-contacted for additional research studies. The Biobank has enabled Partners investigators to compete for nationally recognized grants in personalized medicine such as a clinical electronic Medical Records and Genomics network (eMERGE) site and the national All of US program. The Biobank currently supports over 120 Partners investigators and over 130 million dollars in NIH research. \\n\\n**Kaiser Permanente Washington/ (KPWA) / University of Washington (UW):**&lt;br/&gt; KPWA participants were enrolled in the eMERGE Network through the Northwest Institute of Genetic Medicine (NWIGM) biorepository, and provided the appropriate consent to receive clinically relevant genetic results (N=2,500.) NWIGM is based at the University of Washington and co-managed by the University of Washington and KPWA. The purpose of the NWIGM biorepository is to build infrastructure and resources to carry out a broad range of future genetic research. KPWA members enrolled in the biorepository are asked to provide informed consent to providing a DNA sample for storage in the NWIGM biorepository. The consent is purposefully broad to serve the dual purpose of reducing the burden on researchers who wish to use this biorepository and the IRB committees who will be responsible for reviewing these requests in the future. Participants were eligible if aged 50 - 65 years old at the time of their enrollment into the NWIGM repository, living, enrolled in KPWA&amp;#39;s integrated group practice, and had completed an online Health Risk Appraisal. The selection algorithm was based on several data sources from the EHR at KPWA. 1) Demographics - participants with self-reported race as Asian ancestry were prioritized and selected to enrich for non-European ancestry. The KPWA eMERGE cohort includes N=1,245 members of Asian ancestry. 2) Participants were also selected for a history of colorectal cancer (N=1,255), in order to allow us to enrich germline pathogenic variants. \\n\\n**Mayo Clinic:**&lt;br/&gt; The Return of Actionable Variants Empirical (RAVE) Study was approved by the Mayo Clinic IRB. We recruited 2537 participants from Mayo Clinic biobanks in Rochester, MN, who had hypercholesterolemia or colon polyps, thereby enriching for Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and monogenic causes of colorectal cancer (CRC). Additional eligibility criteria were: 1) residents of Southeast MN who were alive and aged 18-70 years; 2) LDL-C level &amp;#62;155 or &amp;#62;120 mg/dl while on lipid-lowering therapy; 3) no known cause of secondary hyperlipidemia; and 4) no cognitive impairment or dementia that would compromise their ability to give written informed consent. Based on these criteria, we identified 5270 eligible patients and obtained informed consent from 3030 participants. Recruitment was conducted in waves and utilized mailed recruitment packets consisting of a study brochure, a written informed consent form, a baseline psychosocial questionnaire, and a return postage-paid envelope. DNA of 2537 participants was sent for CLIA-certified targeted sequencing of 109 genes including genes associated with FH and CRC. Targeted sequencing and genotyping was performed in a Central Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA)-certified laboratory.\\n\\n**Northwestern University:**&lt;br/&gt; Samples and data used in this study were obtained from patients from Northwestern Medicine, an integrated healthcare system, formed through a partnership of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare and Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Participants include a retrospective cohort from the Northwestern Pharmacogenomics Study, funded through the eMERGE II project, NHGRI (3U01HG006388-02S1) and a prospective cohort from the Genetic Testing and Your Health Study, funded through the eMERGE III project, NHGRI (U01HG008673). Patients were eligible to participate if they were18 years or older and see a physician at Northwestern Medicine. Patients consented to genetic testing and to allow their results to be placed in their electronic medical record.\\n\\n**Vanderbilt University Medical Center:**&lt;br/&gt; Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) participants were enrolled in the eMERGE Network through the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records (VGER) project. Patients were provided the appropriate consent to receive clinically relevant genetic results (N=2,700). Participants were eligible if aged 21 or over, had a healthcare provider at VUMC, and visited the provider at least 3 times in the past 3 years. \\n\\n**Meharry Medical College:**&lt;br/&gt; Inclusion of ethnic groups in genomic research is critical to identify possible reasons for health disparities. African-Americans are being enrolled in various outpatient clinics of Nashville General Hospital at Meharry, an inner city hospital primary serving a poorer patient group. A total of 500 African Americans with four cancer types demonstrating health disparities in this population - prostate, colon, breast, lung are identified and approached by clinical research coordinators. The purpose of the study is to determine if any genetic information can be identified from these patients who have or are at high risk of one of these disparate cancers. All participants provide written informed consent and HIPAA authorization to provide blood samples for broad research use and permission to access data in their hospital electronic medical record for research now and in the future. An extensive demographic profile is obtained and entered into a REDCap database. Blood samples are obtained for a panel of alleles from extracted DNA at Baylor. In addition, de-identified coded samples are processed and stored in a central biorepository for further DNA, RNA and proteomic analyses. The survey and phlebotomy are performed at the time of the initial contact and agreement to participate. Nearly all patients approached willingly agree to participate for potential benefit to themselves, family members, or humankind. Little concern is voiced of providing samples for genetic analysis. Study investigators will share results with the participants and providers if testing does not indicate high risk. Results indicating increased risk or actionable alleles for the patient and/or family will be returned by a genetic counselor. Monitoring of the patients&amp;#39; health in this cohort will continue to be followed in the EMR to identify any future associations that might explain health disparities in African Americans. Proposals will be reviewed from investigators to study the genetic or proteomic samples as well as the clinical and demographic information in the repository.\\n\\nPlease note that this version of the dataset has a handful of mismatches between genotyped and provided sex.

Included in this study are:  - ~24,000 eMERGE participants from 10 eMERGE III study sites. - Corresponding demographics, body mass index measurements. - Top PheWAS codes generated from a collated list of ICD codes from all study sites.  \\n\\nStudy sites and participants include:\\n\\n**Cincinnati Children&amp;#39;s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC):**&lt;br/&gt; Cincinnati Children&amp;#39;s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) is a not-for-profit hospital and research center pioneering breakthrough treatments, providing outstanding family-centered patient care and training healthcare professionals for the future, and dedicated to improving health and welfare of children and to the shared purpose of discovery and practical application of new genomic information to the ordinary care of children. We bring a comprehensive electronic health record (EPIC), a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 680K patient records, a biobank with &amp;#62;261,000 consents that allow return of results to &amp;#62;84,000 patients and guardians who have provided DNA samples, and hundreds of faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. CCHMC will help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify genes for the eMERGE III targeted sequencing panel, provide 3,000 DNA samples from CCHMC patients to be sequenced, review targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis. We will also extend our work generating phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods to many new childhood diseases. We will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, and develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning sequencing results. \\n\\n**Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP):**&lt;br/&gt; The Center for Applied Genomics (CAG) is a specialized Center of Emphasis at the Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), and one of the world&amp;#39;s largest genetics research programs, with to state-of-the-art high-throughput sequencing and genotyping technology. Our primary goal is to translate basic research findings to medical innovations. We aim to develop new and better ways to diagnose and treat children affected by rare and complex medical disorders, including asthma, autism, epilepsy, pediatric cancer, learning disabilities, and a range of rare diseases. Ultimately, our objective is to generate new diagnostic tests and to guide physicians to the most appropriate therapies. Participants were recruited from the CAG biorepository (n&amp;#62;450,000), specifically from &amp;#62;100,000 CHOP pediatric patients and family members, which is enriched for rare-diseases (n&amp;#62;12,000). Center for Applied Genomics, The Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia We gratefully thank all the children and their families who enrolled in this study, and all individuals who donated blood samples for research purposes. Genotyping for this project was performed at the Center for Applied Genomics and supported by an Institutional Development Award from The Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia. Sequencing was supported by the National Institutes of Health through an award from the National Human Genome Research Institute&amp;#39;s Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) program (U01HG008684). \\n\\n**Columbia University:**&lt;br/&gt; The goal of the Columbia eMERGE III project is to develop methods for integrating genomic data in EHRs and to study the impact of such genomic informatics interventions on the health of a diverse, underserved urban adult English- and Spanish-speaking patient population in Northern Manhattan served by Columbia University Medical Center/New York-Presbyterian Hospital system. The study group is 2500 patients recruited from diverse clinics and community outreach centers of self-reported White (~61%), Asian (~11%), African-American (~11%), American Indian/Alaska Native (&amp;#60;1%) racial and Hispanic (~33%) ethnic backgrounds. There are two subgroups in the study cohort - a retrospective group (N=1052) that includes patients from oncology and nephrology clinics, and a prospective one (N=1448) that includes healthy individuals as well as participants with diverse medical conditions. Confirmed pathogenic variants in 70 selected genes will be returned to participants and their healthcare providers through the EHR integration. Participants are able to choose the results they receive and will have the freedom to meet with a genetic counselor and a geneticist to review results. The impact of genetic testing on clinical care is determined by periodic monitoring of EHRs.\\n\\n**Geisinger:**&lt;br/&gt; Samples and phenotype data in this study were provided by the Geisinger MyCode&amp;#174; Community Health Initiative. Participants are recruited across the Geisinger System via online consents or in-person consents at a hospital or clinic visit. Enrollment is ongoing with over 100,000 individuals currently consented.\\n\\n**Partners Healthcare (Harvard University):**&lt;br/&gt; The Partners HealthCare Biobank is a large research program designed to help researchers understand how people&amp;#39;s health is affected by their genes, lifestyle, and environment. This large research data and sample repository provides access to high-quality, consented blood samples to help foster research, advance our understanding of the causes of common diseases, and advance the practice of medicine. For the Partners research community (Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women&amp;#39;s Hospital), the Biobank provides:  - Banked samples (plasma, serum, and DNA) collected from consented patients  - Blood samples that were discarded after clinical testing in the Crimson Cores maintained in the Brigham and Women&amp;#39;s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital Pathology Departments  - Sample handling and preparation services - Link to the biobank data to the Partners Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) a research instance of our electronic clinical chart - Data access through our research portal.  \\n\\nTo date, over 70,000 Partners patients have given their consent to enroll, give a blood sample, receive research results and agreed to be re-contacted for additional research studies. The Biobank has enabled Partners investigators to compete for nationally recognized grants in personalized medicine such as a clinical electronic Medical Records and Genomics network (eMERGE) site and the national All of US program. The Biobank currently supports over 120 Partners investigators and over 130 million dollars in NIH research. \\n\\n**Kaiser Permanente Washington/ (KPWA) / University of Washington (UW):**&lt;br/&gt; KPWA participants were enrolled in the eMERGE Network through the Northwest Institute of Genetic Medicine (NWIGM) biorepository, and provided the appropriate consent to receive clinically relevant genetic results (N=2,500.) NWIGM is based at the University of Washington and co-managed by the University of Washington and KPWA. The purpose of the NWIGM biorepository is to build infrastructure and resources to carry out a broad range of future genetic research. KPWA members enrolled in the biorepository are asked to provide informed consent to providing a DNA sample for storage in the NWIGM biorepository. The consent is purposefully broad to serve the dual purpose of reducing the burden on researchers who wish to use this biorepository and the IRB committees who will be responsible for reviewing these requests in the future. Participants were eligible if aged 50 - 65 years old at the time of their enrollment into the NWIGM repository, living, enrolled in KPWA&amp;#39;s integrated group practice, and had completed an online Health Risk Appraisal. The selection algorithm was based on several data sources from the EHR at KPWA. 1) Demographics - participants with self-reported race as Asian ancestry were prioritized and selected to enrich for non-European ancestry. The KPWA eMERGE cohort includes N=1,245 members of Asian ancestry. 2) Participants were also selected for a history of colorectal cancer (N=1,255), in order to allow us to enrich germline pathogenic variants. \\n\\n**Mayo Clinic:**&lt;br/&gt; The Return of Actionable Variants Empirical (RAVE) Study was approved by the Mayo Clinic IRB. We recruited 2537 participants from Mayo Clinic biobanks in Rochester, MN, who had hypercholesterolemia or colon polyps, thereby enriching for Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and monogenic causes of colorectal cancer (CRC). Additional eligibility criteria were: 1) residents of Southeast MN who were alive and aged 18-70 years; 2) LDL-C level &amp;#62;155 or &amp;#62;120 mg/dl while on lipid-lowering therapy; 3) no known cause of secondary hyperlipidemia; and 4) no cognitive impairment or dementia that would compromise their ability to give written informed consent. Based on these criteria, we identified 5270 eligible patients and obtained informed consent from 3030 participants. Recruitment was conducted in waves and utilized mailed recruitment packets consisting of a study brochure, a written informed consent form, a baseline psychosocial questionnaire, and a return postage-paid envelope. DNA of 2537 participants was sent for CLIA-certified targeted sequencing of 109 genes including genes associated with FH and CRC. Targeted sequencing and genotyping was performed in a Central Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA)-certified laboratory.\\n\\n**Northwestern University:**&lt;br/&gt; Samples and data used in this study were obtained from patients from Northwestern Medicine, an integrated healthcare system, formed through a partnership of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare and Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Participants include a retrospective cohort from the Northwestern Pharmacogenomics Study, funded through the eMERGE II project, NHGRI (3U01HG006388-02S1) and a prospective cohort from the Genetic Testing and Your Health Study, funded through the eMERGE III project, NHGRI (U01HG008673). Patients were eligible to participate if they were18 years or older and see a physician at Northwestern Medicine. Patients consented to genetic testing and to allow their results to be placed in their electronic medical record.\\n\\n**Vanderbilt University Medical Center:**&lt;br/&gt; Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) participants were enrolled in the eMERGE Network through the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records (VGER) project. Patients were provided the appropriate consent to receive clinically relevant genetic results (N=2,700). Participants were eligible if aged 21 or over, had a healthcare provider at VUMC, and visited the provider at least 3 times in the past 3 years. \\n\\n**Meharry Medical College:**&lt;br/&gt; Inclusion of ethnic groups in genomic research is critical to identify possible reasons for health disparities. African-Americans are being enrolled in various outpatient clinics of Nashville General Hospital at Meharry, an inner city hospital primary serving a poorer patient group. A total of 500 African Americans with four cancer types demonstrating health disparities in this population - prostate, colon, breast, lung are identified and approached by clinical research coordinators. The purpose of the study is to determine if any genetic information can be identified from these patients who have or are at high risk of one of these disparate cancers. All participants provide written informed consent and HIPAA authorization to provide blood samples for broad research use and permission to access data in their hospital electronic medical record for research now and in the future. An extensive demographic profile is obtained and entered into a REDCap database. Blood samples are obtained for a panel of alleles from extracted DNA at Baylor. In addition, de-identified coded samples are processed and stored in a central biorepository for further DNA, RNA and proteomic analyses. The survey and phlebotomy are performed at the time of the initial contact and agreement to participate. Nearly all patients approached willingly agree to participate for potential benefit to themselves, family members, or humankind. Little concern is voiced of providing samples for genetic analysis. Study investigators will share results with the participants and providers if testing does not indicate high risk. Results indicating increased risk or actionable alleles for the patient and/or family will be returned by a genetic counselor. Monitoring of the patients&amp;#39; health in this cohort will continue to be followed in the EMR to identify any future associations that might explain health disparities in African Americans. Proposals will be reviewed from investigators to study the genetic or proteomic samples as well as the clinical and demographic information in the repository.\\n\\nPlease note that this version of the dataset has a handful of mismatches between genotyped and provided sex.

We bring a comprehensive electronic health record (EPIC), a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 680K patient records, a biobank with &amp;#62;261,000 consents that allow return of results to &amp;#62;84,000 patients and guardians who have provided DNA samples, and hundreds of faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. CCHMC will help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify genes for the eMERGE III targeted sequencing panel, provide 3,000 DNA samples from CCHMC patients to be sequenced, review targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis. We will also extend our work generating phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods to many new childhood diseases. We will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, and develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning sequencing results. \\n\\n**Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP):**&lt;br/&gt; The Center for Applied Genomics (CAG) is a specialized Center of Emphasis at the Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), and one of the world&amp;#39;s largest genetics research programs, with to state-of-the-art high-throughput sequencing and genotyping technology. Our primary goal is to translate basic research findings to medical innovations. We aim to develop new and better ways to diagnose and treat children affected by rare and complex medical disorders, including asthma, autism, epilepsy, pediatric cancer, learning disabilities, and a range of rare diseases. Ultimately, our objective is to generate new diagnostic tests and to guide physicians to the most appropriate therapies. Participants were recruited from the CAG biorepository (n&amp;#62;450,000), specifically from &amp;#62;100,000 CHOP pediatric patients and family members, which is enriched for rare-diseases (n&amp;#62;12,000). Center for Applied Genomics, The Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia We gratefully thank all the children and their families who enrolled in this study, and all individuals who donated blood samples for research purposes. Genotyping for this project was performed at the Center for Applied Genomics and supported by an Institutional Development Award from The Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia. Sequencing was supported by the National Institutes of Health through an award from the National Human Genome Research Institute&amp;#39;s Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) program (U01HG008684). \\n\\n**Columbia University:**&lt;br/&gt; The goal of the Columbia eMERGE III project is to develop methods for integrating genomic data in EHRs and to study the impact of such genomic informatics interventions on the health of a diverse, underserved urban adult English- and Spanish-speaking patient population in Northern Manhattan served by Columbia University Medical Center/New York-Presbyterian Hospital system. The study group is 2500 patients recruited from diverse clinics and community outreach centers of self-reported White (~61%), Asian (~11%), African-American (~11%), American Indian/Alaska Native (&amp;#60;1%) racial and Hispanic (~33%) ethnic backgrounds. There are two subgroups in the study cohort - a retrospective group (N=1052) that includes patients from oncology and nephrology clinics, and a prospective one (N=1448) that includes healthy individuals as well as participants with diverse medical conditions. Confirmed pathogenic variants in 70 selected genes will be returned to participants and their healthcare providers through the EHR integration. Participants are able to choose the results they receive and will have the freedom to meet with a genetic counselor and a geneticist to review results. The impact of genetic testing on clinical care is determined by periodic monitoring of EHRs.\\n\\n**Geisinger:**&lt;br/&gt; Samples and phenotype data in this study were provided by the Geisinger MyCode&amp;#174; Community Health Initiative. Participants are recruited across the Geisinger System via online consents or in-person consents at a hospital or clinic visit. Enrollment is ongoing with over 100,000 individuals currently consented.\\n\\n**Partners Healthcare (Harvard University):**&lt;br/&gt; The Partners HealthCare Biobank is a large research program designed to help researchers understand how people&amp;#39;s health is affected by their genes, lifestyle, and environment. This large research data and sample repository provides access to high-quality, consented blood samples to help foster research, advance our understanding of the causes of common diseases, and advance the practice of medicine. For the Partners research community (Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women&amp;#39;s Hospital), the Biobank provides:  - Banked samples (plasma, serum, and DNA) collected from consented patients  - Blood samples that were discarded after clinical testing in the Crimson Cores maintained in the Brigham and Women&amp;#39;s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital Pathology Departments  - Sample handling and preparation services - Link to the biobank data to the Partners Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) a research instance of our electronic clinical chart - Data access through our research portal.  \\n\\nTo date, over 70,000 Partners patients have given their consent to enroll, give a blood sample, receive research results and agreed to be re-contacted for additional research studies. The Biobank has enabled Partners investigators to compete for nationally recognized grants in personalized medicine such as a clinical electronic Medical Records and Genomics network (eMERGE) site and the national All of US program. The Biobank currently supports over 120 Partners investigators and over 130 million dollars in NIH research. \\n\\n**Kaiser Permanente Washington/ (KPWA) / University of Washington (UW):**&lt;br/&gt; KPWA participants were enrolled in the eMERGE Network through the Northwest Institute of Genetic Medicine (NWIGM) biorepository, and provided the appropriate consent to receive clinically relevant genetic results (N=2,500.) NWIGM is based at the University of Washington and co-managed by the University of Washington and KPWA. The purpose of the NWIGM biorepository is to build infrastructure and resources to carry out a broad range of future genetic research. KPWA members enrolled in the biorepository are asked to provide informed consent to providing a DNA sample for storage in the NWIGM biorepository. The consent is purposefully broad to serve the dual purpose of reducing the burden on researchers who wish to use this biorepository and the IRB committees who will be responsible for reviewing these requests in the future. Participants were eligible if aged 50 - 65 years old at the time of their enrollment into the NWIGM repository, living, enrolled in KPWA&amp;#39;s integrated group practice, and had completed an online Health Risk Appraisal. The selection algorithm was based on several data sources from the EHR at KPWA. 1) Demographics - participants with self-reported race as Asian ancestry were prioritized and selected to enrich for non-European ancestry. The KPWA eMERGE cohort includes N=1,245 members of Asian ancestry. 2) Participants were also selected for a history of colorectal cancer (N=1,255), in order to allow us to enrich germline pathogenic variants. \\n\\n**Mayo Clinic:**&lt;br/&gt; The Return of Actionable Variants Empirical (RAVE) Study was approved by the Mayo Clinic IRB. We recruited 2537 participants from Mayo Clinic biobanks in Rochester, MN, who had hypercholesterolemia or colon polyps, thereby enriching for Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and monogenic causes of colorectal cancer (CRC). Additional eligibility criteria were: 1) residents of Southeast MN who were alive and aged 18-70 years; 2) LDL-C level &amp;#62;155 or &amp;#62;120 mg/dl while on lipid-lowering therapy; 3) no known cause of secondary hyperlipidemia; and 4) no cognitive impairment or dementia that would compromise their ability to give written informed consent. Based on these criteria, we identified 5270 eligible patients and obtained informed consent from 3030 participants. Recruitment was conducted in waves and utilized mailed recruitment packets consisting of a study brochure, a written informed consent form, a baseline psychosocial questionnaire, and a return postage-paid envelope. DNA of 2537 participants was sent for CLIA-certified targeted sequencing of 109 genes including genes associated with FH and CRC. Targeted sequencing and genotyping was performed in a Central Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA)-certified laboratory.\\n\\n**Northwestern University:**&lt;br/&gt; Samples and data used in this study were obtained from patients from Northwestern Medicine, an integrated healthcare system, formed through a partnership of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare and Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Participants include a retrospective cohort from the Northwestern Pharmacogenomics Study, funded through the eMERGE II project, NHGRI (3U01HG006388-02S1) and a prospective cohort from the Genetic Testing and Your Health Study, funded through the eMERGE III project, NHGRI (U01HG008673). Patients were eligible to participate if they were18 years or older and see a physician at Northwestern Medicine. Patients consented to genetic testing and to allow their results to be placed in their electronic medical record.\\n\\n**Vanderbilt University Medical Center:**&lt;br/&gt; Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) participants were enrolled in the eMERGE Network through the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records (VGER) project. Patients were provided the appropriate consent to receive clinically relevant genetic results (N=2,700). Participants were eligible if aged 21 or over, had a healthcare provider at VUMC, and visited the provider at least 3 times in the past 3 years. \\n\\n**Meharry Medical College:**&lt;br/&gt; Inclusion of ethnic groups in genomic research is critical to identify possible reasons for health disparities. African-Americans are being enrolled in various outpatient clinics of Nashville General Hospital at Meharry, an inner city hospital primary serving a poorer patient group. A total of 500 African Americans with four cancer types demonstrating health disparities in this population - prostate, colon, breast, lung are identified and approached by clinical research coordinators. The purpose of the study is to determine if any genetic information can be identified from these patients who have or are at high risk of one of these disparate cancers. All participants provide written informed consent and HIPAA authorization to provide blood samples for broad research use and permission to access data in their hospital electronic medical record for research now and in the future. An extensive demographic profile is obtained and entered into a REDCap database. Blood samples are obtained for a panel of alleles from extracted DNA at Baylor. In addition, de-identified coded samples are processed and stored in a central biorepository for further DNA, RNA and proteomic analyses. The survey and phlebotomy are performed at the time of the initial contact and agreement to participate. Nearly all patients approached willingly agree to participate for potential benefit to themselves, family members, or humankind. Little concern is voiced of providing samples for genetic analysis. Study investigators will share results with the participants and providers if testing does not indicate high risk. Results indicating increased risk or actionable alleles for the patient and/or family will be returned by a genetic counselor. Monitoring of the patients&amp;#39; health in this cohort will continue to be followed in the EMR to identify any future associations that might explain health disparities in African Americans. Proposals will be reviewed from investigators to study the genetic or proteomic samples as well as the clinical and demographic information in the repository.\\n\\nPlease note that this version of the dataset has a handful of mismatches between genotyped and provided sex.

We will also extend our work generating phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods to many new childhood diseases. We will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, and develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning sequencing results. \\n\\n**Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP):**&lt;br/&gt; The Center for Applied Genomics (CAG) is a specialized Center of Emphasis at the Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), and one of the world&amp;#39;s largest genetics research programs, with to state-of-the-art high-throughput sequencing and genotyping technology. Our primary goal is to translate basic research findings to medical innovations. We aim to develop new and better ways to diagnose and treat children affected by rare and complex medical disorders, including asthma, autism, epilepsy, pediatric cancer, learning disabilities, and a range of rare diseases. Ultimately, our objective is to generate new diagnostic tests and to guide physicians to the most appropriate therapies. Participants were recruited from the CAG biorepository (n&amp;#62;450,000), specifically from &amp;#62;100,000 CHOP pediatric patients and family members, which is enriched for rare-diseases (n&amp;#62;12,000). Center for Applied Genomics, The Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia We gratefully thank all the children and their families who enrolled in this study, and all individuals who donated blood samples for research purposes. Genotyping for this project was performed at the Center for Applied Genomics and supported by an Institutional Development Award from The Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia. Sequencing was supported by the National Institutes of Health through an award from the National Human Genome Research Institute&amp;#39;s Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) program (U01HG008684). \\n\\n**Columbia University:**&lt;br/&gt; The goal of the Columbia eMERGE III project is to develop methods for integrating genomic data in EHRs and to study the impact of such genomic informatics interventions on the health of a diverse, underserved urban adult English- and Spanish-speaking patient population in Northern Manhattan served by Columbia University Medical Center/New York-Presbyterian Hospital system. The study group is 2500 patients recruited from diverse clinics and community outreach centers of self-reported White (~61%), Asian (~11%), African-American (~11%), American Indian/Alaska Native (&amp;#60;1%) racial and Hispanic (~33%) ethnic backgrounds. There are two subgroups in the study cohort - a retrospective group (N=1052) that includes patients from oncology and nephrology clinics, and a prospective one (N=1448) that includes healthy individuals as well as participants with diverse medical conditions. Confirmed pathogenic variants in 70 selected genes will be returned to participants and their healthcare providers through the EHR integration. Participants are able to choose the results they receive and will have the freedom to meet with a genetic counselor and a geneticist to review results. The impact of genetic testing on clinical care is determined by periodic monitoring of EHRs.\\n\\n**Geisinger:**&lt;br/&gt; Samples and phenotype data in this study were provided by the Geisinger MyCode&amp;#174; Community Health Initiative. Participants are recruited across the Geisinger System via online consents or in-person consents at a hospital or clinic visit.

This large research data and sample repository provides access to high-quality, consented blood samples to help foster research, advance our understanding of the causes of common diseases, and advance the practice of medicine. For the Partners research community (Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women&amp;#39;s Hospital), the Biobank provides:  - Banked samples (plasma, serum, and DNA) collected from consented patients  - Blood samples that were discarded after clinical testing in the Crimson Cores maintained in the Brigham and Women&amp;#39;s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital Pathology Departments  - Sample handling and preparation services - Link to the biobank data to the Partners Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) a research instance of our electronic clinical chart - Data access through our research portal.  \\n\\nTo date, over 70,000 Partners patients have given their consent to enroll, give a blood sample, receive research results and agreed to be re-contacted for additional research studies. The Biobank has enabled Partners investigators to compete for nationally recognized grants in personalized medicine such as a clinical electronic Medical Records and Genomics network (eMERGE) site and the national All of US program. The Biobank currently supports over 120 Partners investigators and over 130 million dollars in NIH research. \\n\\n**Kaiser Permanente Washington/ (KPWA) / University of Washington (UW):**&lt;br/&gt; KPWA participants were enrolled in the eMERGE Network through the Northwest Institute of Genetic Medicine (NWIGM) biorepository, and provided the appropriate consent to receive clinically relevant genetic results (N=2,500.) NWIGM is based at the University of Washington and co-managed by the University of Washington and KPWA. The purpose of the NWIGM biorepository is to build infrastructure and resources to carry out a broad range of future genetic research. KPWA members enrolled in the biorepository are asked to provide informed consent to providing a DNA sample for storage in the NWIGM biorepository. The consent is purposefully broad to serve the dual purpose of reducing the burden on researchers who wish to use this biorepository and the IRB committees who will be responsible for reviewing these requests in the future. Participants were eligible if aged 50 - 65 years old at the time of their enrollment into the NWIGM repository, living, enrolled in KPWA&amp;#39;s integrated group practice, and had completed an online Health Risk Appraisal. The selection algorithm was based on several data sources from the EHR at KPWA. 1) Demographics - participants with self-reported race as Asian ancestry were prioritized and selected to enrich for non-European ancestry. The KPWA eMERGE cohort includes N=1,245 members of Asian ancestry. 2) Participants were also selected for a history of colorectal cancer (N=1,255), in order to allow us to enrich germline pathogenic variants. \\n\\n**Mayo Clinic:**&lt;br/&gt; The Return of Actionable Variants Empirical (RAVE) Study was approved by the Mayo Clinic IRB. We recruited 2537 participants from Mayo Clinic biobanks in Rochester, MN, who had hypercholesterolemia or colon polyps, thereby enriching for Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and monogenic causes of colorectal cancer (CRC). Additional eligibility criteria were: 1) residents of Southeast MN who were alive and aged 18-70 years; 2) LDL-C level &amp;#62;155 or &amp;#62;120 mg/dl while on lipid-lowering therapy; 3) no known cause of secondary hyperlipidemia; and 4) no cognitive impairment or dementia that would compromise their ability to give written informed consent. Based on these criteria, we identified 5270 eligible patients and obtained informed consent from 3030 participants. Recruitment was conducted in waves and utilized mailed recruitment packets consisting of a study brochure, a written informed consent form, a baseline psychosocial questionnaire, and a return postage-paid envelope. DNA of 2537 participants was sent for CLIA-certified targeted sequencing of 109 genes including genes associated with FH and CRC. Targeted sequencing and genotyping was performed in a Central Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA)-certified laboratory.\\n\\n**Northwestern University:**&lt;br/&gt; Samples and data used in this study were obtained from patients from Northwestern Medicine, an integrated healthcare system, formed through a partnership of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare and Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Participants include a retrospective cohort from the Northwestern Pharmacogenomics Study, funded through the eMERGE II project, NHGRI (3U01HG006388-02S1) and a prospective cohort from the Genetic Testing and Your Health Study, funded through the eMERGE III project, NHGRI (U01HG008673). Patients were eligible to participate if they were18 years or older and see a physician at Northwestern Medicine. Patients consented to genetic testing and to allow their results to be placed in their electronic medical record.\\n\\n**Vanderbilt University Medical Center:**&lt;br/&gt; Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) participants were enrolled in the eMERGE Network through the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records (VGER) project. Patients were provided the appropriate consent to receive clinically relevant genetic results (N=2,700). Participants were eligible if aged 21 or over, had a healthcare provider at VUMC, and visited the provider at least 3 times in the past 3 years. \\n\\n**Meharry Medical College:**&lt;br/&gt; Inclusion of ethnic groups in genomic research is critical to identify possible reasons for health disparities. African-Americans are being enrolled in various outpatient clinics of Nashville General Hospital at Meharry, an inner city hospital primary serving a poorer patient group. A total of 500 African Americans with four cancer types demonstrating health disparities in this population - prostate, colon, breast, lung are identified and approached by clinical research coordinators. The purpose of the study is to determine if any genetic information can be identified from these patients who have or are at high risk of one of these disparate cancers. All participants provide written informed consent and HIPAA authorization to provide blood samples for broad research use and permission to access data in their hospital electronic medical record for research now and in the future. An extensive demographic profile is obtained and entered into a REDCap database. Blood samples are obtained for a panel of alleles from extracted DNA at Baylor. In addition, de-identified coded samples are processed and stored in a central biorepository for further DNA, RNA and proteomic analyses. The survey and phlebotomy are performed at the time of the initial contact and agreement to participate. Nearly all patients approached willingly agree to participate for potential benefit to themselves, family members, or humankind. Little concern is voiced of providing samples for genetic analysis. Study investigators will share results with the participants and providers if testing does not indicate high risk. Results indicating increased risk or actionable alleles for the patient and/or family will be returned by a genetic counselor. Monitoring of the patients&amp;#39; health in this cohort will continue to be followed in the EMR to identify any future associations that might explain health disparities in African Americans. Proposals will be reviewed from investigators to study the genetic or proteomic samples as well as the clinical and demographic information in the repository.\\n\\nPlease note that this version of the dataset has a handful of mismatches between genotyped and provided sex.

We will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, and develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning sequencing results. \\n\\n**Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP):**&lt;br/&gt; The Center for Applied Genomics (CAG) is a specialized Center of Emphasis at the Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), and one of the world&amp;#39;s largest genetics research programs, with to state-of-the-art high-throughput sequencing and genotyping technology. Our primary goal is to translate basic research findings to medical innovations. We aim to develop new and better ways to diagnose and treat children affected by rare and complex medical disorders, including asthma, autism, epilepsy, pediatric cancer, learning disabilities, and a range of rare diseases. Ultimately, our objective is to generate new diagnostic tests and to guide physicians to the most appropriate therapies. Participants were recruited from the CAG biorepository (n&amp;#62;450,000), specifically from &amp;#62;100,000 CHOP pediatric patients and family members, which is enriched for rare-diseases (n&amp;#62;12,000). Center for Applied Genomics, The Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia We gratefully thank all the children and their families who enrolled in this study, and all individuals who donated blood samples for research purposes. Genotyping for this project was performed at the Center for Applied Genomics and supported by an Institutional Development Award from The Children&amp;#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia. Sequencing was supported by the National Institutes of Health through an award from the National Human Genome Research Institute&amp;#39;s Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) program (U01HG008684). \\n\\n**Columbia University:**&lt;br/&gt; The goal of the Columbia eMERGE III project is to develop methods for integrating genomic data in EHRs and to study the impact of such genomic informatics interventions on the health of a diverse, underserved urban adult English- and Spanish-speaking patient population in Northern Manhattan served by Columbia University Medical Center/New York-Presbyterian Hospital system. The study group is 2500 patients recruited from diverse clinics and community outreach centers of self-reported White (~61%), Asian (~11%), African-American (~11%), American Indian/Alaska Native (&amp;#60;1%) racial and Hispanic (~33%) ethnic backgrounds. There are two subgroups in the study cohort - a retrospective group (N=1052) that includes patients from oncology and nephrology clinics, and a prospective one (N=1448) that includes healthy individuals as well as participants with diverse medical conditions. Confirmed pathogenic variants in 70 selected genes will be returned to participants and their healthcare providers through the EHR integration. Participants are able to choose the results they receive and will have the freedom to meet with a genetic counselor and a geneticist to review results. The impact of genetic testing on clinical care is determined by periodic monitoring of EHRs.\\n\\n**Geisinger:**&lt;br/&gt; Samples and phenotype data in this study were provided by the Geisinger MyCode&amp;#174; Community Health Initiative. Participants are recruited across the Geisinger System via online consents or in-person consents at a hospital or clinic visit. Enrollment is ongoing with over 100,000 individuals currently consented.\\n\\n**Partners Healthcare (Harvard University):**&lt;br/&gt; The Partners HealthCare Biobank is a large research program designed to help researchers understand how people&amp;#39;s health is affected by their genes, lifestyle, and environment. This large research data and sample repository provides access to high-quality, consented blood samples to help foster research, advance our understanding of the causes of common diseases, and advance the practice of medicine. For the Partners research community (Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women&amp;#39;s Hospital), the Biobank provides:  - Banked samples (plasma, serum, and DNA) collected from consented patients  - Blood samples that were discarded after clinical testing in the Crimson Cores maintained in the Brigham and Women&amp;#39;s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital Pathology Departments  - Sample handling and preparation services - Link to the biobank data to the Partners Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) a research instance of our electronic clinical chart - Data access through our research portal.  \\n\\nTo date, over 70,000 Partners patients have given their consent to enroll, give a blood sample, receive research results and agreed to be re-contacted for additional research studies. The Biobank has enabled Partners investigators to compete for nationally recognized grants in personalized medicine such as a clinical electronic Medical Records and Genomics network (eMERGE) site and the national All of US program. The Biobank currently supports over 120 Partners investigators and over 130 million dollars in NIH research. \\n\\n**Kaiser Permanente Washington/ (KPWA) / University of Washington (UW):**&lt;br/&gt; KPWA participants were enrolled in the eMERGE Network through the Northwest Institute of Genetic Medicine (NWIGM) biorepository, and provided the appropriate consent to receive clinically relevant genetic results (N=2,500.) NWIGM is based at the University of Washington and co-managed by the University of Washington and KPWA. The purpose of the NWIGM biorepository is to build infrastructure and resources to carry out a broad range of future genetic research. KPWA members enrolled in the biorepository are asked to provide informed consent to providing a DNA sample for storage in the NWIGM biorepository. The consent is purposefully broad to serve the dual purpose of reducing the burden on researchers who wish to use this biorepository and the IRB committees who will be responsible for reviewing these requests in the future. Participants were eligible if aged 50 - 65 years old at the time of their enrollment into the NWIGM repository, living, enrolled in KPWA&amp;#39;s integrated group practice, and had completed an online Health Risk Appraisal. The selection algorithm was based on several data sources from the EHR at KPWA. 1) Demographics - participants with self-reported race as Asian ancestry were prioritized and selected to enrich for non-European ancestry. The KPWA eMERGE cohort includes N=1,245 members of Asian ancestry. 2) Participants were also selected for a history of colorectal cancer (N=1,255), in order to allow us to enrich germline pathogenic variants. \\n\\n**Mayo Clinic:**&lt;br/&gt; The Return of Actionable Variants Empirical (RAVE) Study was approved by the Mayo Clinic IRB. We recruited 2537 participants from Mayo Clinic biobanks in Rochester, MN, who had hypercholesterolemia or colon polyps, thereby enriching for Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and monogenic causes of colorectal cancer (CRC). Additional eligibility criteria were: 1) residents of Southeast MN who were alive and aged 18-70 years; 2) LDL-C level &amp;#62;155 or &amp;#62;120 mg/dl while on lipid-lowering therapy; 3) no known cause of secondary hyperlipidemia; and 4) no cognitive impairment or dementia that would compromise their ability to give written informed consent. Based on these criteria, we identified 5270 eligible patients and obtained informed consent from 3030 participants. Recruitment was conducted in waves and utilized mailed recruitment packets consisting of a study brochure, a written informed consent form, a baseline psychosocial questionnaire, and a return postage-paid envelope. DNA of 2537 participants was sent for CLIA-certified targeted sequencing of 109 genes including genes associated with FH and CRC. Targeted sequencing and genotyping was performed in a Central Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA)-certified laboratory.\\n\\n**Northwestern University:**&lt;br/&gt; Samples and data used in this study were obtained from patients from Northwestern Medicine, an integrated healthcare system, formed through a partnership of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare and Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Participants include a retrospective cohort from the Northwestern Pharmacogenomics Study, funded through the eMERGE II project, NHGRI (3U01HG006388-02S1) and a prospective cohort from the Genetic Testing and Your Health Study, funded through the eMERGE III project, NHGRI (U01HG008673). Patients were eligible to participate if they were18 years or older and see a physician at Northwestern Medicine. Patients consented to genetic testing and to allow their results to be placed in their electronic medical record.\\n\\n**Vanderbilt University Medical Center:**&lt;br/&gt; Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) participants were enrolled in the eMERGE Network through the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records (VGER) project. Patients were provided the appropriate consent to receive clinically relevant genetic results (N=2,700). Participants were eligible if aged 21 or over, had a healthcare provider at VUMC, and visited the provider at least 3 times in the past 3 years. \\n\\n**Meharry Medical College:**&lt;br/&gt; Inclusion of ethnic groups in genomic research is critical to identify possible reasons for health disparities. African-Americans are being enrolled in various outpatient clinics of Nashville General Hospital at Meharry, an inner city hospital primary serving a poorer patient group. A total of 500 African Americans with four cancer types demonstrating health disparities in this population - prostate, colon, breast, lung are identified and approached by clinical research coordinators. The purpose of the study is to determine if any genetic information can be identified from these patients who have or are at high risk of one of these disparate cancers. All participants provide written informed consent and HIPAA authorization to provide blood samples for broad research use and permission to access data in their hospital electronic medical record for research now and in the future. An extensive demographic profile is obtained and entered into a REDCap database. Blood samples are obtained for a panel of alleles from extracted DNA at Baylor. In addition, de-identified coded samples are processed and stored in a central biorepository for further DNA, RNA and proteomic analyses. The survey and phlebotomy are performed at the time of the initial contact and agreement to participate. Nearly all patients approached willingly agree to participate for potential benefit to themselves, family members, or humankind. Little concern is voiced of providing samples for genetic analysis. Study investigators will share results with the participants and providers if testing does not indicate high risk. Results indicating increased risk or actionable alleles for the patient and/or family will be returned by a genetic counselor. Monitoring of the patients&amp;#39; health in this cohort will continue to be followed in the EMR to identify any future associations that might explain health disparities in African Americans. Proposals will be reviewed from investigators to study the genetic or proteomic samples as well as the clinical and demographic information in the repository.\\n\\nPlease note that this version of the dataset has a handful of mismatches between genotyped and provided sex.

Data is stored in this workspace to allow immediate use by researchers participating in the Human Pangenome Project. Data in this workspace is constantly being added and updated and the workspace is under active development as our production pipeline continues. Note that the HPRC Year 1 data is pending publication, currently scheduled for march of 2022. If you would like to publish using this data please contact the HPRC Coordinating Center at hprcadmin@gowustl.onmicrosoft.com.\\n\\n### Data Table Organization\\n**Sequencing Data:** Sample Table &lt;br/&gt;\\n**Participant Information:** Participant Table &lt;br/&gt;\\n**Assemblies:** Assembly_Sample, Assembly_Annotation Tables &lt;br/&gt;\\n**Pangenomes:** Minigraph, Minigraph_CACTUS, PGGB Tables\\n\\n------------------\\n# Sequencing Data\\nProduction information about the HPRC Y1 samples is in the sections below. Note that samples from the HPRC_PLUS cohort had data assembled from other consortia, and the information in the sections below does not apply.\\n\\n## PacBio HiFi Data From UW and WashU\\nPacBio HiFi sequencing was performed on the Sequel2 instrument using v2 chemistry. Samples were sequenced across 3-5 flowcells in order to generate 35-fold coverage or greater. The average coverage for the year1 samples is &gt;40X with a median insert size of 20kb. The following file types are listed in the table:\\n\\n* {flowcell_id}.ccs.bam - consensus called unaligned bam file\\n\\nConsensus sequences were generated with v4.0.0 of the CCS algorithm\\n\\n## Nanopore PromethION Data From UC Santa Cruz\\n\\nThe UCSC Nanopore PromethION HPP data were generated using the a new long read protocol (details to be published on protocols.io shortly). Briefly, this protocol uses Circulomics discs-based UHMW DNA isolation, followed by library preparation using ONT SQK-RAD004 kit and library cleanup using Circulomics discs. Typically, we used 3 RAD004-based sequencing libraries per PromethION flow cell (and 3 flow cells per individual). The observed read N50s (average) are ~80 kb, with 11x coverage in 100kb+ readsa dn 3x coverage in 200kb+ reads for each individual. The following file types are listed in the table:\\n\\n* sample_Guppy_4.0.11_prom.fastq.gz\\n\\n## Hi-C/Omni-C Data From UCSC\\nOmniC is a restriction enzyme-free HiC protocol. DNA is fragmented using an endonuclease that cuts DNA randomly, i.e., not at specific restriction sites. It uses a biotinylated linker to facilitate proximity ligation. This short linker sequence may be present within the read data. The architecture of an OmniC library molecule is:\\n\\nP5adapter:GenomicRegion:Linker:GenomicRegion:P7adapter\\n\\nDepending on the read length, some or all of the Linker sequence may be present in R1, R2, or both. When present, the Linker sequence is: AGGTTCGTCCATCGATCGATGGACGAACCT Note that the linker sequence is a DNA palindrome. Thus, the Linker sequence will be the same whether present in R1 or R2 (forward or reverse read).\\n\\nFor each HPRC sample, two OmniC libraries are generated and sequenced. Duplicates can be identified and removed within each library, but not between libraries as independent sample material goes into each. Libraries are sequenced across several Novaseq lanes, depending on lane availability, with 2x150 paired-end sequencing.\\n\\nThe raw fastq OmniC data can be aligned using bwa mem with flags -5SP In practice, bwa mem (local alignment) will not omit the Linker sequence from the alignment in cases when it is present in the read.\\n\\nThe following file types are available:\\n\\n* {library_name}.R1_001.fastq.gz - forward reads\\n* {library_name}.R2_001.fastq.gz - reverse reads\\n \\n## Bionano Data From Rockefeller\\nThe following file types are available:\\n\\n* {sample_name}_Saphyr_DLE1_3680591.bnx.gz - raw data view of molecule and label information and quality scores\\n* {sample_name}_Saphyr_DLE1_3680616.cmap - location information for label sites\\n\\nFor information about Bionano file specifications or utilization of Bionano files see Bionano's website.\\n\\n## Strand-seq Data From EMBL\\nStrand-seq is a single-cell sequencing technology that resolves individual homologs within a cell by restricting sequence analysis to the DNA template strands used during DNA replication (see Sanders, et al.). Each sample has 192 fastq.gz files available -- from paired-end sequencing of 96 single cells (nuclei).\\n\\n## Trio Illumina Data From NYGC\\nWhen available, we have included high coverage (30X) Illumina datasets produced by NYGC for select 1000G samples. Information about this dataset can be found at [IGSR](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/data-collection/30x-grch38).\\n\\nNote that the data is stored in CRAM format (aligned to GRCHh38), but is placed in the raw_data area for each sample as the consortium uses the raw reads from the CRAMs. When used in assembly pipelines, the [extract_reads.wdl](https://github.com/human-pangenomics/hpp_production_workflows/blob/master/QC/wdl/tasks/extract_reads.wdl) is used to call samtools fastq to convert the reads to fastq format.\\n\\n\\n------------------\\n# Assemblies\\n\\nThe **assembly_sample** holds assemblies from year 1 data. Assemblies from 47 samples have been uploaded to Genbank and released. Genbank accessions can be found [here](https://github.com/human-pangenomics/HPP_Year1_Assemblies/blob/main/genbank_changes/y1_genbank_assembly_accession_ids.txt). The table has columns for maternal and paternal fastas alongside columns for each assembly aligned to both CHM13 and GRCh38. The **assembly_annotation** table holds annotation files for the assemblies found in the **assembly_sample** table.\\n\\nFor more information about the assembly process see the [Y1 Assembly GitHub repo](https://github.com/human-pangenomics/HPP_Year1_Assemblies)\\n## Assembly Metrics\\n**Select metrics from the [automated assembly QC]() are shown below**\\n\\n### QV\\n![QV](https://github.com/human-pangenomics/HPP_Year1_Assemblies/blob/main/automated_qc_results/Y1_assemblies_v2_genbank_QV.png?raw=true)\\n\\n### N50\\n![N50](https://github.com/human-pangenomics/HPP_Year1_Assemblies/blob/main/automated_qc_results/Y1_assemblies_v2_genbank_N50.png?raw=true)\\n\\n### Hamming Error Rate\\n![Hamming](https://github.com/human-pangenomics/HPP_Year1_Assemblies/blob/main/automated_qc_results/Y1_assemblies_v2_genbank_hamming.png?raw=true)\\n\\n### Switch Error Rate\\n![Switch](https://github.com/human-pangenomics/HPP_Year1_Assemblies/blob/main/automated_qc_results/Y1_assemblies_v2_genbank_switch.png?raw=true)\\n\\n------------------\\n\\n# Pangenomes\\nPangenomes are available from three different strategies summarized in the table (and relevant sections) below:\\n\\n| &lt;sub&gt; &lt;/sub&gt; | &lt;sub&gt;**Minigraph**&lt;/sub&gt; | &lt;sub&gt;**Minigraph-Cactus**&lt;/sub&gt; | &lt;sub&gt;**PGGB**&lt;/sub&gt; |\\n| :-------- | :-------- | :------ | :------ |\\n| &lt;sub&gt; sequence comparison &lt;/sub&gt; | &lt;sub&gt; reference-based, progressive &lt;/sub&gt; | &lt;sub&gt; reference-based, progressive &lt;/sub&gt; | &lt;sub&gt; symmetric, all-vs-all &lt;/sub&gt; |\\n| &lt;sub&gt; resolution &lt;/sub&gt; | &lt;sub&gt; SV only &lt;/sub&gt; | &lt;sub&gt; base-level (via abPOA) &lt;/sub&gt; | &lt;sub&gt; base-level (via abPOA) &lt;/sub&gt; |\\n| &lt;sub&gt; scope &lt;/sub&gt; | &lt;sub&gt; full assemblies &lt;/sub&gt; | &lt;sub&gt; Non-centromeric &lt;/sub&gt; | &lt;sub&gt; full assemblies &lt;/sub&gt; |\\n| &lt;sub&gt; cyclic paths &lt;/sub&gt; | &lt;sub&gt; no &lt;/sub&gt; | &lt;sub&gt; non-reference &lt;/sub&gt; | &lt;sub&gt; all &lt;/sub&gt; |\\n| &lt;sub&gt; short read mapping &lt;/sub&gt; | &lt;sub&gt; untested &lt;/sub&gt; | &lt;sub&gt; yes (fast) &lt;/sub&gt; | &lt;sub&gt; untested &lt;/sub&gt; |\\n| &lt;sub&gt; long read mapping &lt;/sub&gt; | &lt;sub&gt; yes (fastest) &lt;/sub&gt; | &lt;sub&gt; yes &lt;/sub&gt; | &lt;sub&gt; yes (slowest) &lt;/sub&gt; |\\n| &lt;sub&gt; Assembly mapping &lt;/sub&gt; | &lt;sub&gt; yes (direct) &lt;/sub&gt; | &lt;sub&gt; untested &lt;/sub&gt; | &lt;sub&gt; yes (via injection) &lt;/sub&gt; |\\n\\n\\n### Assembly Inputs\\n\\nThe assemblies in the **assembly_sample** table were used as inputs to graph building pipelines. Of the 47 samples assembled (94 assemblies) in year 1, all but three samples were included in graph constructions (HG002, HG005 and NA19240 were excluded for evaluation purposes). GRCh38 and CHM13 were added to make the total number of haplotypes included 90.\\n\\n\\n## Graphs\\n### Minigraph\\n\\n[Minigraph](https://github.com/lh3/minigraph) is a generalization of minimap2 (very fast) which builds the graph with iterative construction. Minigraph aligns with approximate locations and can be used to call structural variants (&gt;50nt). Graphs were built with both GRCh38 and CHM13+Y (found [here](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/human-pangenomics/pangenomes/freeze/freeze1/minigraph/CHM13v11Y.fa.gz)) used as reference sequences.\\n\\nGraphs and associated files are available in the **minigraph** table.\\n\\n### Minigraph/CACTUS\\n\\n[The CACTUS pangenome pipeline](https://github.com/ComparativeGenomicsToolkit/cactus/blob/master/doc/pangenome.md) adds base-level alignments to the minigraph graphs above (so both GRCh38- and CHM13-based graphs are available). Centromeric regions are removed during  Minigraph/CACTUS graph creation.\\n\\nGraphs and associated files are available in the **minigraph_cactus** table.\\n\\nThe graphs are available in gfa format alongside other graph and index files. Information about the associated file formats can be found:\\n* graph formats: [xg/gg](https://github.com/vgteam/vg/wiki/Index-Types)\\n* index formats: [gbwt/dist/min](https://github.com/vgteam/vg/wiki/Index-Types)\\n* snarls format: [snarls](https://github.com/vgteam/vg/wiki/Index-Construction)\\n\\n#### Filtered Graphs\\nThe [Giraffe](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.04.412486v2.abstract) short read mapper relies on the graph's snarl decomposition.  The versions of the Cactus/Minigraph graphs released here contain some spurious large deletion edges that make this decomposition less efficient, which impacts Giraffe *runtime*. Furthermore, we have found that for calling small variants with the Giraffe-[DeepVariant](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.4235) pipeline, *accuracy* is improved if all alleles with frequency &lt; 10% are removed from the graph before indexing.

This cohort study of over 215,000 men and women in Hawaii and California is unique in that it is population-based and includes large representations of older adults (45-75 yrs at baseline) for five US racial/ethnic groups (Japanese Americans, African Americans, European Americans, Latinos and Native Hawaiians) at varying risks of chronic diseases. Within the PAGE investigation, the MEC proposes to study: 1) diseases for which we have DNA available for large numbers of cases and controls (breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer, diabetes, and obesity); 2) important cancers that are less common (e.g., lung, pancreas, endometrial cancers, NHL) but for which we propose to pool our data with other funded groups; 3) common traits that are risk factors for these diseases (e.g., body mass index/weight, waist-to-hip ratio, height) and 4) relevant disease-associated biomarkers (e.g., fasting insulin and lipids, steroid hormones). The specific aims are: 1) To determine the population-based epidemiologic profile (allele frequency, main effect, heterogeneity by disease characteristics) of putative causal variants in the five racial/ethnic groups in the MEC; 2) for variants displaying effect heterogeneity across ethnic/racial groups, we will utilize differences in LD to identify a more complete spectrum of associated variants at these loci; 3) investigate gene x gene and gene x environment interactions to identify modifiers; 4) examine the associations of putative causal variants with already measured intermediate phenotypes (e.g., plasma insulin, lipids, steroid hormones); and 5) for variants that do not fall within known genes, start to investigate their relationships with gene expression and epigenetic patterns in small genomic studies.\\n\\nThis study is part of the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study [phs000356](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000356).\\n</td>\n",

These chronic diseases are the major causes of death, disability and frailty in older women of all races and socioeconomic backgrounds.\\n\\nThis cohort is sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), involves 161,808 women aged 50-79, and is one of the most definitive, far-reaching clinical trials of post-menopausal women&amp;#39;s health ever undertaken in the U.S. Women were recruited between 1993 to 1998 at 40 centers across the US and follow up is planned to continue until at least 2015. The WHI Clinical Trial and Observational Study focused on many of the inequities in women&amp;#39;s health research and will continue to provide practical information to women and their physicians about hormone therapy, dietary patterns, calcium/vitamin D supplementation, and their effects on the prevention of heart disease, cancer and osteoporotic fractures.\\n\\nThe WHI has two major parts: a randomized Clinical Trial and an Observational Study. The randomized controlled Clinical Trial (CT) enrolled 68,132 postmenopausal women between the ages of 50-79 into trials testing three prevention strategies. If eligible, women could choose to enroll in one, two, or all three of the trial components. The components are:  - **Hormone Therapy Trials (HT)**: This component examined the effects of combined hormones or estrogen alone on the prevention of coronary heart disease and osteoporotic fractures, and associated risk for breast cancer. Women participating in this component took hormone pills or a placebo (inactive pill) until the Estrogen plus Progestin and Estrogen Alone trials were stopped early in July 2002 and March 2004, respectively. All HT participants continued to be followed without intervention until close-out. - **Dietary Modification Trial (DM)**: The Dietary Modification component evaluated the effect of a low-fat and high fruit, vegetable and grain diet on the prevention of breast and colorectal cancers and coronary heart disease. Study participants followed either their usual eating pattern or a low-fat dietary pattern. - **Calcium/Vitamin D Trial (CaD)**: This component began 1 to 2 years after a woman joined one or both of the other clinical trial components. It evaluated the effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on the prevention of osteoporotic fractures and colorectal cancer. Women in this component took calcium and vitamin D pills or a placebo.  \\n\\nThe **Observational Study (OS)** is examining the relationship between lifestyle, health and risk factors and specific disease outcomes. This component involves tracking the medical history and health habits of 93,676 women.\\n\\nTo fully examine the profile of gene and environment interaction, or \"epidemiologic architecture,\" we will comprehensively evaluate such putative genuine variants in the Women&amp;#39;s Health Initiative This large study population not only enables us to examine the population incidence for racial and ethnic subgroups and associated risks of rigorously defined, incident diseases (specific aim 1) but allows us to investigate associated risks given in-depth information on various environmental exposures and disease risk factors as well as three randomized interventions (hormone therapy; low-fat dietary modification; calcium + vitamin D supplements) (specific aim 2). The prospective and longitudinal collection of biospecimens, intermediate outcomes, and phenotypic characteristics, such as bone mineral density, hormone concentrations, breast density, or inflammation will further permit us to link genetic variants to relevant intermediate phenotypes, which will potentially provide important clues to the biological basis of the genuine associations (specific aim 3). For a variety of outcomes we will genotype within this 4-year project 72,000 participants for disease-specific putative genuine variants. Information generated from this study will be critical to determine the health impact of any given undisputable variant. Findings may also provide valuable insights into disease pathways and mechanisms, and targets for disease screening, prevention, and treatment.\\n\\nThis study is part of the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study ([phs000356](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000356)).\\n</td>\n",

Using a combination of PacBio HiFi sequencing and Oxford Nanopore ultra long reads, the recently released CHM13v1 reference genome is nearly perfect, with an estimated sequence accuracy exceeding QV70 and only 5 rRNA arrays left unresolved. The genome includes more than 100 Mbp of novel sequence compared to GRCh38, corrects many structural errors in the GRCh38 reference genome, and unlocks the most complex regions of the genome to clinical and functional study for the first time.\\n\\n### Currently Available Data\\nHere we use the T2T-CHM13 reference genome to investigate how it improves variant calling for individual samples, trios, and population-scale analysis. This includes 17 samples from diverse ethnicities sequenced with long reads that we analyze for SNVs, indels and structural variants using PEPPER-Margin-DeepVariant and Sniffles, along with all 3,202 short-read samples from the recently extended 1000 Genomes Project collection that we analyze using the GATK HaplotypeCaller for SNVs and indels on the NHGRI AnVIL Cloud Platform. We demonstrate that the CHM13 reference improves read mapping and variant calling across all samples in a number of major ways:\\n1. Adds over 80 million base pairs of sequence that can be effectively used for variant calling with long reads\\n2. Eliminates false positive variant calls in functional and medically relevant genes such as MAP2K3 and ZNF717 by adding sequences not present in GRCh38\\n3. Corrects missed variants related to false duplications in GRCh38, including within genes like CBS and KCNE1\\n4. Improves structural variant analysis, especially the balance of large insertion and deletion structural variant calls, by correcting collapsed tandem repeats in GRCh38\\n5. Reduces the rate of false de novo mutations and Mendelian violations found among trios\\n\\nFor more information, see the paper:\\n\\n[A complete reference genome improves analysis of human genetic variation](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.12.452063)&lt;br&gt;\\nAganezov, S*, Yan, SM*, Soto, DC*, Kirsche, M*, Zarate, S*, Avdeyev, P, Taylor, DJ, Shafin, K, Shumate, A, Xiao, C, Wagner, J, McDaniel, J, Olson, ND, Sauria, MEG, Vollger, MR, Rhie, A, Meredith, M, Martin, S, Lee, J, Koren, S, Rosenfeld, J, Paten, B, Layer, R, Chin, CS, Sedlazeck, FJ, Hansen, NF, Miller, DE, Phillippy, AM, Miga, KM, McCoy, RC†, Dennis, MY†, Zook, JW†, Schatz, MC† (2021) bioRxiv doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.12.452063\\n</td>\n",

funded a collaborative large-scale genome sequencing effort to comprehensively identify rare risk and protective variants contributing to multiple common disease phenotypes. Called the Centers for Common Disease Genomics (CCDG), this initiative will explore a range of diseases with the ultimate goal of: undertaking variant discovery for enough different examples of disease architectures and study designs to better understand the general principles of the genomic architecture underlying common, complex inherited diseases; understanding how best to design rare variant studies for common disease; developing resources, informatics tools, and innovative approaches and technologies for multiple disease research communities and the wider biomedical research community. The initial focus of the CCDGs will be in cardiovascular disease (early-onset coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, hemorrhagic stroke), neuropsychiatric disease (epilepsy, autism), and autoimmune/inflammatory disease (type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease). The Broad Institute is one of four selected CCDG project centers. The overarching aim of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) program is to define the full allelic spectrum of protein-altering variation in genes associated to IBD, and assess their role in both Crohn's Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC) risk. The whole genome sequencing data generated here is comprised of samples from US-based diverse populations including African American, Puerto-Rican, Caribean and Cuban origins. \\n   \n",

bringing together expert large-scale sequencing center (at the Baylor College of Medicine, PI Richard Gibbs and the Board Institute of MIT and Harvard, PI Mark J. Daly) and a collaborative network of research labs focused on the genetics of autism (brought together by the Autism Genome Project and the Autism Consortium). These groups worked together to utilize dramatic new advances in DNA sequencing technology to reveal the genetic architecture of autism through comprehensive examination of the exotic sequence of all genes. The Autism Sequencing Consortium (ASC) was founded by Joseph D. Buxbaum and colleagues as an international group of scientists who share autism spectrum disorder (ASD) samples and genetic data. The PIs are Drs. Joseph D. Buxbaum (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai), Mark J. Daly (Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard), Bernie Devlin (University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine), Kathryn Roeder (Carnegie Mellon University, Matthew State and Stephan Sanders (University of California, San Francisco). The rationale for the ASC is described in [Buxbaum et al. 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23259942), and this paper should be cited when referencing the data set. All shared data and analysis is hosted at a single site, which enables joint analysis of large-scale data from many groups. The ASC was first supported by a cooperative agreement grant to four lead sites funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (U01MH100233, U01MH100209, U01MH100229, U01MH100239), with additional support from the National Human Genome Research Institute. The NIMH recently renewed their support with a second grant (U01MH111661, U01MH111660, U01MH111658 and U01MH111662) to expand the project from 29,000 genomes to more than 50,000 exomes over the next 5 years. NHGRI provides ongoing sequencing support for the ASD through the Broad Center for Common Disease Genomics (UM1HG008895, Mark Daly, PI).\\n   \n",

variants including defects in gene regulatory circuits and uncharacterized genes present challenges for rare disease diagnosis. In Genomic Answers for Kids program we apply the joint interpretation of patient genome sequence with genomic endophenotypes to expand the clinically actionable genome among pediatric cases of suspected genetic disease. Our objective is to examine the role of novel and under-interpreted sequence variation by combining complete DNA sequences, personal epigenetic variations and massively parallel functional screens.\\n\\nTo achieve this we perform augmented whole genome sequence (WGS) interpretation including reanalysis of clinical exomes as well as generating WGS for patients with negative exome results all be subject to family-based semi-automated recall pipeline to discover missed diagnostic variation. We use linked-read and long-read sequencing technologies to focus on putative structural variants missed in short-read genome and exome analysis by the optimized integration of linked and long read technologies that also improve identification of transmission patterns of all variants, as well as resolving genomic regions resistant to standard alignment. We also include tissue DNA sequencing to investigate somatic mosaicism.\\n\\nTo further assist on WGS interpretation for uncommon variation we capture snapshots of patient transcriptomes and epigenomes in individual cells using single-cell RNA (scRNA) and sc open chromatin (scATAC) as well as bulk whole genome bisulphite genome sequencing for methylome interpretation. Alternative splicing is functionally assessed in available patient tissues using RNA-seq, including full length cDNA sequences by IsoSeq (PacBio) methodology.\\n\\nOur overarching goal is an increase rate of diagnostic genomic findings up to two-fold among rare disease, resulting in the majority (>50%) of patient cases resolved by the integrated system developed in our program.\\n   \n",

variants including defects in gene regulatory circuits and uncharacterized genes present challenges for rare disease diagnosis. In Genomic Answers for Kids program we apply the joint interpretation of patient genome sequence with genomic endophenotypes to expand the clinically actionable genome among pediatric cases of suspected genetic disease. Our objective is to examine the role of novel and under-interpreted sequence variation by combining complete DNA sequences, personal epigenetic variations and massively parallel functional screens.\\n\\nTo achieve this we perform augmented whole genome sequence (WGS) interpretation including reanalysis of clinical exomes as well as generating WGS for patients with negative exome results all be subject to family-based semi-automated recall pipeline to discover missed diagnostic variation. We use linked-read and long-read sequencing technologies to focus on putative structural variants missed in short-read genome and exome analysis by the optimized integration of linked and long read technologies that also improve identification of transmission patterns of all variants, as well as resolving genomic regions resistant to standard alignment. We also include tissue DNA sequencing to investigate somatic mosaicism.\\n\\nTo further assist on WGS interpretation for uncommon variation we capture snapshots of patient transcriptomes and epigenomes in individual cells using single-cell RNA (scRNA) and sc open chromatin (scATAC) as well as bulk whole genome bisulphite genome sequencing for methylome interpretation. Alternative splicing is functionally assessed in available patient tissues using RNA-seq, including full length cDNA sequences by IsoSeq (PacBio) methodology.\\n\\nOur overarching goal is an increase rate of diagnostic genomic findings up to two-fold among rare disease, resulting in the majority (>50%) of patient cases resolved by the integrated system developed in our program.\\n   \n",

variants including defects in gene regulatory circuits and uncharacterized genes present challenges for rare disease diagnosis. In Genomic Answers for Kids program we apply the joint interpretation of patient genome sequence with genomic endophenotypes to expand the clinically actionable genome among pediatric cases of suspected genetic disease. Our objective is to examine the role of novel and under-interpreted sequence variation by combining complete DNA sequences, personal epigenetic variations and massively parallel functional screens.\\n\\nTo achieve this we perform augmented whole genome sequence (WGS) interpretation including reanalysis of clinical exomes as well as generating WGS for patients with negative exome results all be subject to family-based semi-automated recall pipeline to discover missed diagnostic variation. We use linked-read and long-read sequencing technologies to focus on putative structural variants missed in short-read genome and exome analysis by the optimized integration of linked and long read technologies that also improve identification of transmission patterns of all variants, as well as resolving genomic regions resistant to standard alignment. We also include tissue DNA sequencing to investigate somatic mosaicism.\\n\\nTo further assist on WGS interpretation for uncommon variation we capture snapshots of patient transcriptomes and epigenomes in individual cells using single-cell RNA (scRNA) and sc open chromatin (scATAC) as well as bulk whole genome bisulphite genome sequencing for methylome interpretation. Alternative splicing is functionally assessed in available patient tissues using RNA-seq, including full length cDNA sequences by IsoSeq (PacBio) methodology.\\n\\nOur overarching goal is an increase rate of diagnostic genomic findings up to two-fold among rare disease, resulting in the majority (>50%) of patient cases resolved by the integrated system developed in our program.\\n   \n",

variants including defects in gene regulatory circuits and uncharacterized genes present challenges for rare disease diagnosis. In Genomic Answers for Kids program we apply the joint interpretation of patient genome sequence with genomic endophenotypes to expand the clinically actionable genome among pediatric cases of suspected genetic disease. Our objective is to examine the role of novel and under-interpreted sequence variation by combining complete DNA sequences, personal epigenetic variations and massively parallel functional screens.\\n\\nTo achieve this we perform augmented whole genome sequence (WGS) interpretation including reanalysis of clinical exomes as well as generating WGS for patients with negative exome results all be subject to family-based semi-automated recall pipeline to discover missed diagnostic variation. We use linked-read and long-read sequencing technologies to focus on putative structural variants missed in short-read genome and exome analysis by the optimized integration of linked and long read technologies that also improve identification of transmission patterns of all variants, as well as resolving genomic regions resistant to standard alignment. We also include tissue DNA sequencing to investigate somatic mosaicism.\\n\\nTo further assist on WGS interpretation for uncommon variation we capture snapshots of patient transcriptomes and epigenomes in individual cells using single-cell RNA (scRNA) and sc open chromatin (scATAC) as well as bulk whole genome bisulphite genome sequencing for methylome interpretation. Alternative splicing is functionally assessed in available patient tissues using RNA-seq, including full length cDNA sequences by IsoSeq (PacBio) methodology.\\n\\nOur overarching goal is an increase rate of diagnostic genomic findings up to two-fold among rare disease, resulting in the majority (>50%) of patient cases resolved by the integrated system developed in our program.\\n   \n",

variants including defects in gene regulatory circuits and uncharacterized genes present challenges for rare disease diagnosis. In Genomic Answers for Kids program we apply the joint interpretation of patient genome sequence with genomic endophenotypes to expand the clinically actionable genome among pediatric cases of suspected genetic disease. Our objective is to examine the role of novel and under-interpreted sequence variation by combining complete DNA sequences, personal epigenetic variations and massively parallel functional screens.\\n\\nTo achieve this we perform augmented whole genome sequence (WGS) interpretation including reanalysis of clinical exomes as well as generating WGS for patients with negative exome results all be subject to family-based semi-automated recall pipeline to discover missed diagnostic variation. We use linked-read and long-read sequencing technologies to focus on putative structural variants missed in short-read genome and exome analysis by the optimized integration of linked and long read technologies that also improve identification of transmission patterns of all variants, as well as resolving genomic regions resistant to standard alignment. We also include tissue DNA sequencing to investigate somatic mosaicism.\\n\\nTo further assist on WGS interpretation for uncommon variation we capture snapshots of patient transcriptomes and epigenomes in individual cells using single-cell RNA (scRNA) and sc open chromatin (scATAC) as well as bulk whole genome bisulphite genome sequencing for methylome interpretation. Alternative splicing is functionally assessed in available patient tissues using RNA-seq, including full length cDNA sequences by IsoSeq (PacBio) methodology.\\n\\nOur overarching goal is an increase rate of diagnostic genomic findings up to two-fold among rare disease, resulting in the majority (>50%) of patient cases resolved by the integrated system developed in our program.\\n   \n",

interdisciplinary project is to develop powerful, generalizable approaches for discovering how risk variants for psychiatric disorders shape neurobiological processes at multiple levels of analysis, and to identify the processes whose dysregulation underlies disease.\\n\\nInduced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were used towards the development of these new experimental and inferential systems bridging gaps between human genetics and experimental biology. The largest publicly available collection of iPSCs (2607 lines) has been generated from 2184 donors by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM). We wish to share the available SNP data for 2166 CIRM lines and whole genome sequence data generated at the Broad Institute for 299 of the CIRM iPSC donors. These data can be used to identify (for experiments) lines with specific genotypes of interest and lines from donors with high or low polygenic risk scores for phenotypes of interest. The data can also be used to identify acquired mutations in the iPSC lines. The CIRM iPSC lines are available through Fujifilm Cellular Dynamics iPSC Repository [[https://www.fujifilmcdi.com/cirm-ipsc-products/](https://www.fujifilmcdi.com/cirm-ipsc-products/)].\\n\\nAdditional project data registered with the study includes WGS data from an iPSC line derived from an SMA patient (n=1), as well as single-cell RNA sequence data and supplemental processed genomic datasets in support of project publications.\\n\\n**Molecular Datasets**\\n\\n  - **Whole Genome Genotyping**: Illumina HumanCore chip - **Whole Genome Sequencing**: Illumina Novaseq - **Single-Cell RNA-Seq**: 10X Genomics, Illumina Novaseq - **Supplemental \"cell village\" pooled genomic sequence data**: Illumina Nextseq  \\n   \n",

interdisciplinary project is to develop powerful, generalizable approaches for discovering how risk variants for psychiatric disorders shape neurobiological processes at multiple levels of analysis, and to identify the processes whose dysregulation underlies disease.\\n\\nInduced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were used towards the development of these new experimental and inferential systems bridging gaps between human genetics and experimental biology. The largest publicly available collection of iPSCs (2607 lines) has been generated from 2184 donors by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM). We wish to share the available SNP data for 2166 CIRM lines and whole genome sequence data generated at the Broad Institute for 299 of the CIRM iPSC donors. These data can be used to identify (for experiments) lines with specific genotypes of interest and lines from donors with high or low polygenic risk scores for phenotypes of interest. The data can also be used to identify acquired mutations in the iPSC lines. The CIRM iPSC lines are available through Fujifilm Cellular Dynamics iPSC Repository [[https://www.fujifilmcdi.com/cirm-ipsc-products/](https://www.fujifilmcdi.com/cirm-ipsc-products/)].\\n\\nAdditional project data registered with the study includes WGS data from an iPSC line derived from an SMA patient (n=1), as well as single-cell RNA sequence data and supplemental processed genomic datasets in support of project publications.\\n\\n**Molecular Datasets**\\n\\n  - **Whole Genome Genotyping**: Illumina HumanCore chip - **Whole Genome Sequencing**: Illumina Novaseq - **Single-Cell RNA-Seq**: 10X Genomics, Illumina Novaseq - **Supplemental \"cell village\" pooled genomic sequence data**: Illumina Nextseq  \\n   \n",

interdisciplinary project is to develop powerful, generalizable approaches for discovering how risk variants for psychiatric disorders shape neurobiological processes at multiple levels of analysis, and to identify the processes whose dysregulation underlies disease.\\n\\nInduced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were used towards the development of these new experimental and inferential systems bridging gaps between human genetics and experimental biology. The largest publicly available collection of iPSCs (2607 lines) has been generated from 2184 donors by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM). We wish to share the available SNP data for 2166 CIRM lines and whole genome sequence data generated at the Broad Institute for 299 of the CIRM iPSC donors. These data can be used to identify (for experiments) lines with specific genotypes of interest and lines from donors with high or low polygenic risk scores for phenotypes of interest. The data can also be used to identify acquired mutations in the iPSC lines. The CIRM iPSC lines are available through Fujifilm Cellular Dynamics iPSC Repository [[https://www.fujifilmcdi.com/cirm-ipsc-products/](https://www.fujifilmcdi.com/cirm-ipsc-products/)].\\n\\nAdditional project data registered with the study includes WGS data from an iPSC line derived from an SMA patient (n=1), as well as single-cell RNA sequence data and supplemental processed genomic datasets in support of project publications.\\n\\n**Molecular Datasets**\\n\\n  - **Whole Genome Genotyping**: Illumina HumanCore chip - **Whole Genome Sequencing**: Illumina Novaseq - **Single-Cell RNA-Seq**: 10X Genomics, Illumina Novaseq - **Supplemental \"cell village\" pooled genomic sequence data**: Illumina Nextseq  \\n   \n",

interdisciplinary project is to develop powerful, generalizable approaches for discovering how risk variants for psychiatric disorders shape neurobiological processes at multiple levels of analysis, and to identify the processes whose dysregulation underlies disease.\\n\\nInduced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were used towards the development of these new experimental and inferential systems bridging gaps between human genetics and experimental biology. The largest publicly available collection of iPSCs (2607 lines) has been generated from 2184 donors by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM). We wish to share the available SNP data for 2166 CIRM lines and whole genome sequence data generated at the Broad Institute for 299 of the CIRM iPSC donors. These data can be used to identify (for experiments) lines with specific genotypes of interest and lines from donors with high or low polygenic risk scores for phenotypes of interest. The data can also be used to identify acquired mutations in the iPSC lines. The CIRM iPSC lines are available through Fujifilm Cellular Dynamics iPSC Repository [[https://www.fujifilmcdi.com/cirm-ipsc-products/](https://www.fujifilmcdi.com/cirm-ipsc-products/)].\\n\\nAdditional project data registered with the study includes WGS data from an iPSC line derived from an SMA patient (n=1), as well as single-cell RNA sequence data and supplemental processed genomic datasets in support of project publications.\\n\\n**Molecular Datasets**\\n\\n  - **Whole Genome Genotyping**: Illumina HumanCore chip - **Whole Genome Sequencing**: Illumina Novaseq - **Single-Cell RNA-Seq**: 10X Genomics, Illumina Novaseq - **Supplemental \"cell village\" pooled genomic sequence data**: Illumina Nextseq  \\n   \n",

Carolina Clinical Genomic Evaluation by Next-gen Exome Sequencing, 2 (NCGENES 2)</i> study is part of a larger consortium project investigating the clinical utility, or net benefit of an intervention on patient and family well-being as well as diagnostic efficacy, management planning, and medical outcomes. A clinical trial will be implemented to compare (1) first-line exome sequencing to usual care and (2) participant pre-visit preparation to no pre-visit preparation. The study will use a randomized controlled design, with 2x2 factorial design, coupled with patient-reported outcomes and comprehensive clinical data collection addressing key outcomes, to determine the net impact of diagnostic results and secondary findings.</p>   \n",

Evidence-Generating Research (CS.ER2) effort, aimed to assess the utility of clinical exome sequencing and how it affects care in diverse populations. The study population included adults at risk for hereditary cancer syndromes. The primary objective was the implementation of a hereditary cancer risk assessment program in healthy 18-49 year-olds in primary care settings within a vertically integrated health delivery system (Kaiser Permanente) and a federal qualified health center (Denver Health). The investigators aimed to assess clinical exome sequencing implementation and interpretation, as well as tailored interactions for low health literacy including a contextualized consent process, and a modified approach to results disclosure and genetic counseling. The investigators were also assessing the clinical utility (healthcare utilization and adherence to recommended care) and personal utility of primary and additional results from clinical exome sequencing, and evaluate the ethical and policy implications of considering personal utility of genomic information decisions for health care coverage.Sequencing and analysis for CHARM was conducted at the Northwest Clinical Genomics Laboratory, University of Washington, Seattle (<a href=\"https://nwgc.gs.washington.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">https://nwgc.gs.washington.edu/</a>).</div><br>   \n",

Sequencing Evidence-Generating Research ([CSER2](https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/Clinical-Sequencing-Evidence-Generating-Research-CSER2)) effort, aims to perform genome sequencing for infants in nurseries at hospitals in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Kentucky. SouthSeq aims to sequence 600 newborn babies presenting with congenital anomalies, or other signs of a rare genetic disorder. The primary goals of SouthSeq are to provide early diagnoses to children with rare genetic conditions, to demonstrate the utility of genome sequencing as a frontline test with potential to improve intermediate and long-term clinical outcomes, and to equip non-genetics providers to deliver test results in order to facilitate the conduction of genome sequencing outside of major medical centers where patients may not have access to a genetics provider. SouthSeq also aims to ensure that genomic testing is applied across diverse communities; recruitment efforts focus on patients from rural and minority populations that have been historically under-represented in both medicine and genomics research.&nbsp;\\n\\nSequencing and analysis for SouthSeq are being conducted at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology in Huntsville, Alabama ([https://www.hudsonalpha.org/](https://www.hudsonalpha.org/)). Enrollment of infants with signs of genetic disease is approved at five clinical sites, including nurseries at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, the University of Mississippi Medical Center, Woman's Hospital in Baton Rouge, Children's Hospital in New Orleans, and the University of Louisville. Both biological parents are enrolled when available so that follow-up testing can be performed to determine inheritance. Further, participant families may choose to opt-into return of secondary findings identified in the proband, which focus on pathogenic and likely pathogenic variation identified within ACMG SFv3.0 genes.\\n\\n   \n",

The primary goal of the eMERGE Network is to develop, disseminate, and apply approaches to research that combine biorepositories with electronic medical record (EMR) systems for genomic discovery and genomic medicine implementation research. eMERGE was announced in September 2007 and began its third phase in September 2015. eMERGE III consists of nine study sites, two central sequencing and genotyping facilities, and a coordinating center. eMERGE Phase III aims to: 1) sequence and assess the phenotypic implication of rare variants in a custom designed eMERGEseq panel consisting of 109 genes (including 56 ACMG actionable finding list genes and the top 6 genes from each site relevant to their specific aims), as well as approximately 1400 SNPs; 2) assess the phenotypic implications of these variants by developing, validating and implementing new phenotype algorithms, 3) integrate genetic variants into EMRs to inform clinical care; and 4) create community resources. Included in this study are:  - ~24,000 eMERGE participants from 10 eMERGE III study sites. - Corresponding demographics, body mass index measurements. - Top PheWAS codes generated from a collated list of ICD codes from all study sites.  \\n\\nStudy sites and participants include:\\n\\n**Cincinnati Children&#39;s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC):**<br/> Cincinnati Children&#39;s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) is a not-for-profit hospital and research center pioneering breakthrough treatments, providing outstanding family-centered patient care and training healthcare professionals for the future, and dedicated to improving health and welfare of children and to the shared purpose of discovery and practical application of new genomic information to the ordinary care of children. We bring a comprehensive electronic health record (EPIC), a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 680K patient records, a biobank with &#62;261,000 consents that allow return of results to &#62;84,000 patients and guardians who have provided DNA samples, and hundreds of faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. CCHMC will help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify genes for the eMERGE III targeted sequencing panel, provide 3,000 DNA samples from CCHMC patients to be sequenced, review targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis. We will also extend our work generating phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods to many new childhood diseases. We will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, and develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning sequencing results. \\n\\n**Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP):**<br/> The Center for Applied Genomics (CAG) is a specialized Center of Emphasis at the Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), and one of the world&#39;s largest genetics research programs, with to state-of-the-art high-throughput sequencing and genotyping technology. Our primary goal is to translate basic research findings to medical innovations. We aim to develop new and better ways to diagnose and treat children affected by rare and complex medical disorders, including asthma, autism, epilepsy, pediatric cancer, learning disabilities, and a range of rare diseases. Ultimately, our objective is to generate new diagnostic tests and to guide physicians to the most appropriate therapies. Participants were recruited from the CAG biorepository (n&#62;450,000), specifically from &#62;100,000 CHOP pediatric patients and family members, which is enriched for rare-diseases (n&#62;12,000). Center for Applied Genomics, The Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia We gratefully thank all the children and their families who enrolled in this study, and all individuals who donated blood samples for research purposes. Genotyping for this project was performed at the Center for Applied Genomics and supported by an Institutional Development Award from The Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia. Sequencing was supported by the National Institutes of Health through an award from the National Human Genome Research Institute&#39;s Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) program (U01HG008684). \\n\\n**Columbia University:**<br/> The goal of the Columbia eMERGE III project is to develop methods for integrating genomic data in EHRs and to study the impact of such genomic informatics interventions on the health of a diverse, underserved urban adult English- and Spanish-speaking patient population in Northern Manhattan served by Columbia University Medical Center/New York-Presbyterian Hospital system. The study group is 2500 patients recruited from diverse clinics and community outreach centers of self-reported White (~61%), Asian (~11%), African-American (~11%), American Indian/Alaska Native (&#60;1%) racial and Hispanic (~33%) ethnic backgrounds. There are two subgroups in the study cohort - a retrospective group (N=1052) that includes patients from oncology and nephrology clinics, and a prospective one (N=1448) that includes healthy individuals as well as participants with diverse medical conditions. Confirmed pathogenic variants in 70 selected genes will be returned to participants and their healthcare providers through the EHR integration. Participants are able to choose the results they receive and will have the freedom to meet with a genetic counselor and a geneticist to review results. The impact of genetic testing on clinical care is determined by periodic monitoring of EHRs.\\n\\n**Geisinger:**<br/> Samples and phenotype data in this study were provided by the Geisinger MyCode&#174; Community Health Initiative. Participants are recruited across the Geisinger System via online consents or in-person consents at a hospital or clinic visit. Enrollment is ongoing with over 100,000 individuals currently consented.\\n\\n**Partners Healthcare (Harvard University):**<br/> The Partners HealthCare Biobank is a large research program designed to help researchers understand how people&#39;s health is affected by their genes, lifestyle, and environment. This large research data and sample repository provides access to high-quality, consented blood samples to help foster research, advance our understanding of the causes of common diseases, and advance the practice of medicine. For the Partners research community (Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital), the Biobank provides:  - Banked samples (plasma, serum, and DNA) collected from consented patients  - Blood samples that were discarded after clinical testing in the Crimson Cores maintained in the Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital Pathology Departments  - Sample handling and preparation services - Link to the biobank data to the Partners Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) a research instance of our electronic clinical chart - Data access through our research portal.  \\n\\nTo date, over 70,000 Partners patients have given their consent to enroll, give a blood sample, receive research results and agreed to be re-contacted for additional research studies. The Biobank has enabled Partners investigators to compete for nationally recognized grants in personalized medicine such as a clinical electronic Medical Records and Genomics network (eMERGE) site and the national All of US program. The Biobank currently supports over 120 Partners investigators and over 130 million dollars in NIH research. \\n\\n**Kaiser Permanente Washington/ (KPWA) / University of Washington (UW):**<br/> KPWA participants were enrolled in the eMERGE Network through the Northwest Institute of Genetic Medicine (NWIGM) biorepository, and provided the appropriate consent to receive clinically relevant genetic results (N=2,500.) NWIGM is based at the University of Washington and co-managed by the University of Washington and KPWA. The purpose of the NWIGM biorepository is to build infrastructure and resources to carry out a broad range of future genetic research. KPWA members enrolled in the biorepository are asked to provide informed consent to providing a DNA sample for storage in the NWIGM biorepository. The consent is purposefully broad to serve the dual purpose of reducing the burden on researchers who wish to use this biorepository and the IRB committees who will be responsible for reviewing these requests in the future. Participants were eligible if aged 50 - 65 years old at the time of their enrollment into the NWIGM repository, living, enrolled in KPWA&#39;s integrated group practice, and had completed an online Health Risk Appraisal. The selection algorithm was based on several data sources from the EHR at KPWA. 1) Demographics - participants with self-reported race as Asian ancestry were prioritized and selected to enrich for non-European ancestry. The KPWA eMERGE cohort includes N=1,245 members of Asian ancestry. 2) Participants were also selected for a history of colorectal cancer (N=1,255), in order to allow us to enrich germline pathogenic variants. \\n\\n**Mayo Clinic:**<br/> The Return of Actionable Variants Empirical (RAVE) Study was approved by the Mayo Clinic IRB. We recruited 2537 participants from Mayo Clinic biobanks in Rochester, MN, who had hypercholesterolemia or colon polyps, thereby enriching for Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and monogenic causes of colorectal cancer (CRC). Additional eligibility criteria were: 1) residents of Southeast MN who were alive and aged 18-70 years; 2) LDL-C level &#62;155 or &#62;120 mg/dl while on lipid-lowering therapy; 3) no known cause of secondary hyperlipidemia; and 4) no cognitive impairment or dementia that would compromise their ability to give written informed consent. Based on these criteria, we identified 5270 eligible patients and obtained informed consent from 3030 participants. Recruitment was conducted in waves and utilized mailed recruitment packets consisting of a study brochure, a written informed consent form, a baseline psychosocial questionnaire, and a return postage-paid envelope. DNA of 2537 participants was sent for CLIA-certified targeted sequencing of 109 genes including genes associated with FH and CRC. Targeted sequencing and genotyping was performed in a Central Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA)-certified laboratory.\\n\\n**Northwestern University:**<br/> Samples and data used in this study were obtained from patients from Northwestern Medicine, an integrated healthcare system, formed through a partnership of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare and Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Participants include a retrospective cohort from the Northwestern Pharmacogenomics Study, funded through the eMERGE II project, NHGRI (3U01HG006388-02S1) and a prospective cohort from the Genetic Testing and Your Health Study, funded through the eMERGE III project, NHGRI (U01HG008673). Patients were eligible to participate if they were18 years or older and see a physician at Northwestern Medicine. Patients consented to genetic testing and to allow their results to be placed in their electronic medical record.\\n\\n**Vanderbilt University Medical Center:**<br/> Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) participants were enrolled in the eMERGE Network through the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records (VGER) project. Patients were provided the appropriate consent to receive clinically relevant genetic results (N=2,700). Participants were eligible if aged 21 or over, had a healthcare provider at VUMC, and visited the provider at least 3 times in the past 3 years. \\n\\n**Meharry Medical College:**<br/> Inclusion of ethnic groups in genomic research is critical to identify possible reasons for health disparities. African-Americans are being enrolled in various outpatient clinics of Nashville General Hospital at Meharry, an inner city hospital primary serving a poorer patient group. A total of 500 African Americans with four cancer types demonstrating health disparities in this population - prostate, colon, breast, lung are identified and approached by clinical research coordinators. The purpose of the study is to determine if any genetic information can be identified from these patients who have or are at high risk of one of these disparate cancers. All participants provide written informed consent and HIPAA authorization to provide blood samples for broad research use and permission to access data in their hospital electronic medical record for research now and in the future. An extensive demographic profile is obtained and entered into a REDCap database. Blood samples are obtained for a panel of alleles from extracted DNA at Baylor. In addition, de-identified coded samples are processed and stored in a central biorepository for further DNA, RNA and proteomic analyses. The survey and phlebotomy are performed at the time of the initial contact and agreement to participate. Nearly all patients approached willingly agree to participate for potential benefit to themselves, family members, or humankind. Little concern is voiced of providing samples for genetic analysis. Study investigators will share results with the participants and providers if testing does not indicate high risk. Results indicating increased risk or actionable alleles for the patient and/or family will be returned by a genetic counselor. Monitoring of the patients&#39; health in this cohort will continue to be followed in the EMR to identify any future associations that might explain health disparities in African Americans. Proposals will be reviewed from investigators to study the genetic or proteomic samples as well as the clinical and demographic information in the repository.\\n\\nPlease note that this version of the dataset has a handful of mismatches between genotyped and provided sex.

The primary goal of the eMERGE Network is to develop, disseminate, and apply approaches to research that combine biorepositories with electronic medical record (EMR) systems for genomic discovery and genomic medicine implementation research. eMERGE was announced in September 2007 and began its third phase in September 2015. eMERGE III consists of nine study sites, two central sequencing and genotyping facilities, and a coordinating center. eMERGE Phase III aims to: 1) sequence and assess the phenotypic implication of rare variants in a custom designed eMERGEseq panel consisting of 109 genes (including 56 ACMG actionable finding list genes and the top 6 genes from each site relevant to their specific aims), as well as approximately 1400 SNPs; 2) assess the phenotypic implications of these variants by developing, validating and implementing new phenotype algorithms, 3) integrate genetic variants into EMRs to inform clinical care; and 4) create community resources. Included in this study are:  - ~24,000 eMERGE participants from 10 eMERGE III study sites. - Corresponding demographics, body mass index measurements. - Top PheWAS codes generated from a collated list of ICD codes from all study sites.  \\n\\nStudy sites and participants include:\\n\\n**Cincinnati Children&#39;s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC):**<br/> Cincinnati Children&#39;s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) is a not-for-profit hospital and research center pioneering breakthrough treatments, providing outstanding family-centered patient care and training healthcare professionals for the future, and dedicated to improving health and welfare of children and to the shared purpose of discovery and practical application of new genomic information to the ordinary care of children. We bring a comprehensive electronic health record (EPIC), a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 680K patient records, a biobank with &#62;261,000 consents that allow return of results to &#62;84,000 patients and guardians who have provided DNA samples, and hundreds of faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. CCHMC will help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify genes for the eMERGE III targeted sequencing panel, provide 3,000 DNA samples from CCHMC patients to be sequenced, review targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis. We will also extend our work generating phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods to many new childhood diseases. We will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, and develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning sequencing results. \\n\\n**Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP):**<br/> The Center for Applied Genomics (CAG) is a specialized Center of Emphasis at the Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), and one of the world&#39;s largest genetics research programs, with to state-of-the-art high-throughput sequencing and genotyping technology. Our primary goal is to translate basic research findings to medical innovations. We aim to develop new and better ways to diagnose and treat children affected by rare and complex medical disorders, including asthma, autism, epilepsy, pediatric cancer, learning disabilities, and a range of rare diseases. Ultimately, our objective is to generate new diagnostic tests and to guide physicians to the most appropriate therapies. Participants were recruited from the CAG biorepository (n&#62;450,000), specifically from &#62;100,000 CHOP pediatric patients and family members, which is enriched for rare-diseases (n&#62;12,000). Center for Applied Genomics, The Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia We gratefully thank all the children and their families who enrolled in this study, and all individuals who donated blood samples for research purposes. Genotyping for this project was performed at the Center for Applied Genomics and supported by an Institutional Development Award from The Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia. Sequencing was supported by the National Institutes of Health through an award from the National Human Genome Research Institute&#39;s Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) program (U01HG008684). \\n\\n**Columbia University:**<br/> The goal of the Columbia eMERGE III project is to develop methods for integrating genomic data in EHRs and to study the impact of such genomic informatics interventions on the health of a diverse, underserved urban adult English- and Spanish-speaking patient population in Northern Manhattan served by Columbia University Medical Center/New York-Presbyterian Hospital system. The study group is 2500 patients recruited from diverse clinics and community outreach centers of self-reported White (~61%), Asian (~11%), African-American (~11%), American Indian/Alaska Native (&#60;1%) racial and Hispanic (~33%) ethnic backgrounds. There are two subgroups in the study cohort - a retrospective group (N=1052) that includes patients from oncology and nephrology clinics, and a prospective one (N=1448) that includes healthy individuals as well as participants with diverse medical conditions. Confirmed pathogenic variants in 70 selected genes will be returned to participants and their healthcare providers through the EHR integration. Participants are able to choose the results they receive and will have the freedom to meet with a genetic counselor and a geneticist to review results. The impact of genetic testing on clinical care is determined by periodic monitoring of EHRs.\\n\\n**Geisinger:**<br/> Samples and phenotype data in this study were provided by the Geisinger MyCode&#174; Community Health Initiative. Participants are recruited across the Geisinger System via online consents or in-person consents at a hospital or clinic visit. Enrollment is ongoing with over 100,000 individuals currently consented.\\n\\n**Partners Healthcare (Harvard University):**<br/> The Partners HealthCare Biobank is a large research program designed to help researchers understand how people&#39;s health is affected by their genes, lifestyle, and environment. This large research data and sample repository provides access to high-quality, consented blood samples to help foster research, advance our understanding of the causes of common diseases, and advance the practice of medicine. For the Partners research community (Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital), the Biobank provides:  - Banked samples (plasma, serum, and DNA) collected from consented patients  - Blood samples that were discarded after clinical testing in the Crimson Cores maintained in the Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital Pathology Departments  - Sample handling and preparation services - Link to the biobank data to the Partners Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) a research instance of our electronic clinical chart - Data access through our research portal.  \\n\\nTo date, over 70,000 Partners patients have given their consent to enroll, give a blood sample, receive research results and agreed to be re-contacted for additional research studies. The Biobank has enabled Partners investigators to compete for nationally recognized grants in personalized medicine such as a clinical electronic Medical Records and Genomics network (eMERGE) site and the national All of US program. The Biobank currently supports over 120 Partners investigators and over 130 million dollars in NIH research. \\n\\n**Kaiser Permanente Washington/ (KPWA) / University of Washington (UW):**<br/> KPWA participants were enrolled in the eMERGE Network through the Northwest Institute of Genetic Medicine (NWIGM) biorepository, and provided the appropriate consent to receive clinically relevant genetic results (N=2,500.) NWIGM is based at the University of Washington and co-managed by the University of Washington and KPWA. The purpose of the NWIGM biorepository is to build infrastructure and resources to carry out a broad range of future genetic research. KPWA members enrolled in the biorepository are asked to provide informed consent to providing a DNA sample for storage in the NWIGM biorepository. The consent is purposefully broad to serve the dual purpose of reducing the burden on researchers who wish to use this biorepository and the IRB committees who will be responsible for reviewing these requests in the future. Participants were eligible if aged 50 - 65 years old at the time of their enrollment into the NWIGM repository, living, enrolled in KPWA&#39;s integrated group practice, and had completed an online Health Risk Appraisal. The selection algorithm was based on several data sources from the EHR at KPWA. 1) Demographics - participants with self-reported race as Asian ancestry were prioritized and selected to enrich for non-European ancestry. The KPWA eMERGE cohort includes N=1,245 members of Asian ancestry. 2) Participants were also selected for a history of colorectal cancer (N=1,255), in order to allow us to enrich germline pathogenic variants. \\n\\n**Mayo Clinic:**<br/> The Return of Actionable Variants Empirical (RAVE) Study was approved by the Mayo Clinic IRB. We recruited 2537 participants from Mayo Clinic biobanks in Rochester, MN, who had hypercholesterolemia or colon polyps, thereby enriching for Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and monogenic causes of colorectal cancer (CRC). Additional eligibility criteria were: 1) residents of Southeast MN who were alive and aged 18-70 years; 2) LDL-C level &#62;155 or &#62;120 mg/dl while on lipid-lowering therapy; 3) no known cause of secondary hyperlipidemia; and 4) no cognitive impairment or dementia that would compromise their ability to give written informed consent. Based on these criteria, we identified 5270 eligible patients and obtained informed consent from 3030 participants. Recruitment was conducted in waves and utilized mailed recruitment packets consisting of a study brochure, a written informed consent form, a baseline psychosocial questionnaire, and a return postage-paid envelope. DNA of 2537 participants was sent for CLIA-certified targeted sequencing of 109 genes including genes associated with FH and CRC. Targeted sequencing and genotyping was performed in a Central Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA)-certified laboratory.\\n\\n**Northwestern University:**<br/> Samples and data used in this study were obtained from patients from Northwestern Medicine, an integrated healthcare system, formed through a partnership of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare and Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Participants include a retrospective cohort from the Northwestern Pharmacogenomics Study, funded through the eMERGE II project, NHGRI (3U01HG006388-02S1) and a prospective cohort from the Genetic Testing and Your Health Study, funded through the eMERGE III project, NHGRI (U01HG008673). Patients were eligible to participate if they were18 years or older and see a physician at Northwestern Medicine. Patients consented to genetic testing and to allow their results to be placed in their electronic medical record.\\n\\n**Vanderbilt University Medical Center:**<br/> Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) participants were enrolled in the eMERGE Network through the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records (VGER) project. Patients were provided the appropriate consent to receive clinically relevant genetic results (N=2,700). Participants were eligible if aged 21 or over, had a healthcare provider at VUMC, and visited the provider at least 3 times in the past 3 years. \\n\\n**Meharry Medical College:**<br/> Inclusion of ethnic groups in genomic research is critical to identify possible reasons for health disparities. African-Americans are being enrolled in various outpatient clinics of Nashville General Hospital at Meharry, an inner city hospital primary serving a poorer patient group. A total of 500 African Americans with four cancer types demonstrating health disparities in this population - prostate, colon, breast, lung are identified and approached by clinical research coordinators. The purpose of the study is to determine if any genetic information can be identified from these patients who have or are at high risk of one of these disparate cancers. All participants provide written informed consent and HIPAA authorization to provide blood samples for broad research use and permission to access data in their hospital electronic medical record for research now and in the future. An extensive demographic profile is obtained and entered into a REDCap database. Blood samples are obtained for a panel of alleles from extracted DNA at Baylor. In addition, de-identified coded samples are processed and stored in a central biorepository for further DNA, RNA and proteomic analyses. The survey and phlebotomy are performed at the time of the initial contact and agreement to participate. Nearly all patients approached willingly agree to participate for potential benefit to themselves, family members, or humankind. Little concern is voiced of providing samples for genetic analysis. Study investigators will share results with the participants and providers if testing does not indicate high risk. Results indicating increased risk or actionable alleles for the patient and/or family will be returned by a genetic counselor. Monitoring of the patients&#39; health in this cohort will continue to be followed in the EMR to identify any future associations that might explain health disparities in African Americans. Proposals will be reviewed from investigators to study the genetic or proteomic samples as well as the clinical and demographic information in the repository.\\n\\nPlease note that this version of the dataset has a handful of mismatches between genotyped and provided sex.

The primary goal of the eMERGE Network is to develop, disseminate, and apply approaches to research that combine biorepositories with electronic medical record (EMR) systems for genomic discovery and genomic medicine implementation research. eMERGE was announced in September 2007 and began its third phase in September 2015. eMERGE III consists of nine study sites, two central sequencing and genotyping facilities, and a coordinating center. eMERGE Phase III aims to: 1) sequence and assess the phenotypic implication of rare variants in a custom designed eMERGEseq panel consisting of 109 genes (including 56 ACMG actionable finding list genes and the top 6 genes from each site relevant to their specific aims), as well as approximately 1400 SNPs; 2) assess the phenotypic implications of these variants by developing, validating and implementing new phenotype algorithms, 3) integrate genetic variants into EMRs to inform clinical care; and 4) create community resources. Included in this study are:  - ~24,000 eMERGE participants from 10 eMERGE III study sites. - Corresponding demographics, body mass index measurements. - Top PheWAS codes generated from a collated list of ICD codes from all study sites.  \\n\\nStudy sites and participants include:\\n\\n**Cincinnati Children&#39;s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC):**<br/> Cincinnati Children&#39;s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) is a not-for-profit hospital and research center pioneering breakthrough treatments, providing outstanding family-centered patient care and training healthcare professionals for the future, and dedicated to improving health and welfare of children and to the shared purpose of discovery and practical application of new genomic information to the ordinary care of children. We bring a comprehensive electronic health record (EPIC), a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 680K patient records, a biobank with &#62;261,000 consents that allow return of results to &#62;84,000 patients and guardians who have provided DNA samples, and hundreds of faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. CCHMC will help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify genes for the eMERGE III targeted sequencing panel, provide 3,000 DNA samples from CCHMC patients to be sequenced, review targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis. We will also extend our work generating phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods to many new childhood diseases. We will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, and develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning sequencing results. \\n\\n**Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP):**<br/> The Center for Applied Genomics (CAG) is a specialized Center of Emphasis at the Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), and one of the world&#39;s largest genetics research programs, with to state-of-the-art high-throughput sequencing and genotyping technology. Our primary goal is to translate basic research findings to medical innovations. We aim to develop new and better ways to diagnose and treat children affected by rare and complex medical disorders, including asthma, autism, epilepsy, pediatric cancer, learning disabilities, and a range of rare diseases. Ultimately, our objective is to generate new diagnostic tests and to guide physicians to the most appropriate therapies. Participants were recruited from the CAG biorepository (n&#62;450,000), specifically from &#62;100,000 CHOP pediatric patients and family members, which is enriched for rare-diseases (n&#62;12,000). Center for Applied Genomics, The Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia We gratefully thank all the children and their families who enrolled in this study, and all individuals who donated blood samples for research purposes. Genotyping for this project was performed at the Center for Applied Genomics and supported by an Institutional Development Award from The Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia. Sequencing was supported by the National Institutes of Health through an award from the National Human Genome Research Institute&#39;s Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) program (U01HG008684). \\n\\n**Columbia University:**<br/> The goal of the Columbia eMERGE III project is to develop methods for integrating genomic data in EHRs and to study the impact of such genomic informatics interventions on the health of a diverse, underserved urban adult English- and Spanish-speaking patient population in Northern Manhattan served by Columbia University Medical Center/New York-Presbyterian Hospital system. The study group is 2500 patients recruited from diverse clinics and community outreach centers of self-reported White (~61%), Asian (~11%), African-American (~11%), American Indian/Alaska Native (&#60;1%) racial and Hispanic (~33%) ethnic backgrounds. There are two subgroups in the study cohort - a retrospective group (N=1052) that includes patients from oncology and nephrology clinics, and a prospective one (N=1448) that includes healthy individuals as well as participants with diverse medical conditions. Confirmed pathogenic variants in 70 selected genes will be returned to participants and their healthcare providers through the EHR integration. Participants are able to choose the results they receive and will have the freedom to meet with a genetic counselor and a geneticist to review results. The impact of genetic testing on clinical care is determined by periodic monitoring of EHRs.\\n\\n**Geisinger:**<br/> Samples and phenotype data in this study were provided by the Geisinger MyCode&#174; Community Health Initiative. Participants are recruited across the Geisinger System via online consents or in-person consents at a hospital or clinic visit. Enrollment is ongoing with over 100,000 individuals currently consented.\\n\\n**Partners Healthcare (Harvard University):**<br/> The Partners HealthCare Biobank is a large research program designed to help researchers understand how people&#39;s health is affected by their genes, lifestyle, and environment. This large research data and sample repository provides access to high-quality, consented blood samples to help foster research, advance our understanding of the causes of common diseases, and advance the practice of medicine. For the Partners research community (Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital), the Biobank provides:  - Banked samples (plasma, serum, and DNA) collected from consented patients  - Blood samples that were discarded after clinical testing in the Crimson Cores maintained in the Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital Pathology Departments  - Sample handling and preparation services - Link to the biobank data to the Partners Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) a research instance of our electronic clinical chart - Data access through our research portal.  \\n\\nTo date, over 70,000 Partners patients have given their consent to enroll, give a blood sample, receive research results and agreed to be re-contacted for additional research studies. The Biobank has enabled Partners investigators to compete for nationally recognized grants in personalized medicine such as a clinical electronic Medical Records and Genomics network (eMERGE) site and the national All of US program. The Biobank currently supports over 120 Partners investigators and over 130 million dollars in NIH research. \\n\\n**Kaiser Permanente Washington/ (KPWA) / University of Washington (UW):**<br/> KPWA participants were enrolled in the eMERGE Network through the Northwest Institute of Genetic Medicine (NWIGM) biorepository, and provided the appropriate consent to receive clinically relevant genetic results (N=2,500.) NWIGM is based at the University of Washington and co-managed by the University of Washington and KPWA. The purpose of the NWIGM biorepository is to build infrastructure and resources to carry out a broad range of future genetic research. KPWA members enrolled in the biorepository are asked to provide informed consent to providing a DNA sample for storage in the NWIGM biorepository. The consent is purposefully broad to serve the dual purpose of reducing the burden on researchers who wish to use this biorepository and the IRB committees who will be responsible for reviewing these requests in the future. Participants were eligible if aged 50 - 65 years old at the time of their enrollment into the NWIGM repository, living, enrolled in KPWA&#39;s integrated group practice, and had completed an online Health Risk Appraisal. The selection algorithm was based on several data sources from the EHR at KPWA. 1) Demographics - participants with self-reported race as Asian ancestry were prioritized and selected to enrich for non-European ancestry. The KPWA eMERGE cohort includes N=1,245 members of Asian ancestry. 2) Participants were also selected for a history of colorectal cancer (N=1,255), in order to allow us to enrich germline pathogenic variants. \\n\\n**Mayo Clinic:**<br/> The Return of Actionable Variants Empirical (RAVE) Study was approved by the Mayo Clinic IRB. We recruited 2537 participants from Mayo Clinic biobanks in Rochester, MN, who had hypercholesterolemia or colon polyps, thereby enriching for Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and monogenic causes of colorectal cancer (CRC). Additional eligibility criteria were: 1) residents of Southeast MN who were alive and aged 18-70 years; 2) LDL-C level &#62;155 or &#62;120 mg/dl while on lipid-lowering therapy; 3) no known cause of secondary hyperlipidemia; and 4) no cognitive impairment or dementia that would compromise their ability to give written informed consent. Based on these criteria, we identified 5270 eligible patients and obtained informed consent from 3030 participants. Recruitment was conducted in waves and utilized mailed recruitment packets consisting of a study brochure, a written informed consent form, a baseline psychosocial questionnaire, and a return postage-paid envelope. DNA of 2537 participants was sent for CLIA-certified targeted sequencing of 109 genes including genes associated with FH and CRC. Targeted sequencing and genotyping was performed in a Central Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA)-certified laboratory.\\n\\n**Northwestern University:**<br/> Samples and data used in this study were obtained from patients from Northwestern Medicine, an integrated healthcare system, formed through a partnership of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare and Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Participants include a retrospective cohort from the Northwestern Pharmacogenomics Study, funded through the eMERGE II project, NHGRI (3U01HG006388-02S1) and a prospective cohort from the Genetic Testing and Your Health Study, funded through the eMERGE III project, NHGRI (U01HG008673). Patients were eligible to participate if they were18 years or older and see a physician at Northwestern Medicine. Patients consented to genetic testing and to allow their results to be placed in their electronic medical record.\\n\\n**Vanderbilt University Medical Center:**<br/> Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) participants were enrolled in the eMERGE Network through the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records (VGER) project. Patients were provided the appropriate consent to receive clinically relevant genetic results (N=2,700). Participants were eligible if aged 21 or over, had a healthcare provider at VUMC, and visited the provider at least 3 times in the past 3 years. \\n\\n**Meharry Medical College:**<br/> Inclusion of ethnic groups in genomic research is critical to identify possible reasons for health disparities. African-Americans are being enrolled in various outpatient clinics of Nashville General Hospital at Meharry, an inner city hospital primary serving a poorer patient group. A total of 500 African Americans with four cancer types demonstrating health disparities in this population - prostate, colon, breast, lung are identified and approached by clinical research coordinators. The purpose of the study is to determine if any genetic information can be identified from these patients who have or are at high risk of one of these disparate cancers. All participants provide written informed consent and HIPAA authorization to provide blood samples for broad research use and permission to access data in their hospital electronic medical record for research now and in the future. An extensive demographic profile is obtained and entered into a REDCap database. Blood samples are obtained for a panel of alleles from extracted DNA at Baylor. In addition, de-identified coded samples are processed and stored in a central biorepository for further DNA, RNA and proteomic analyses. The survey and phlebotomy are performed at the time of the initial contact and agreement to participate. Nearly all patients approached willingly agree to participate for potential benefit to themselves, family members, or humankind. Little concern is voiced of providing samples for genetic analysis. Study investigators will share results with the participants and providers if testing does not indicate high risk. Results indicating increased risk or actionable alleles for the patient and/or family will be returned by a genetic counselor. Monitoring of the patients&#39; health in this cohort will continue to be followed in the EMR to identify any future associations that might explain health disparities in African Americans. Proposals will be reviewed from investigators to study the genetic or proteomic samples as well as the clinical and demographic information in the repository.\\n\\nPlease note that this version of the dataset has a handful of mismatches between genotyped and provided sex.

The primary goal of the eMERGE Network is to develop, disseminate, and apply approaches to research that combine biorepositories with electronic medical record (EMR) systems for genomic discovery and genomic medicine implementation research. eMERGE was announced in September 2007 and began its third phase in September 2015. eMERGE III consists of nine study sites, two central sequencing and genotyping facilities, and a coordinating center. eMERGE Phase III aims to: 1) sequence and assess the phenotypic implication of rare variants in a custom designed eMERGEseq panel consisting of 109 genes (including 56 ACMG actionable finding list genes and the top 6 genes from each site relevant to their specific aims), as well as approximately 1400 SNPs; 2) assess the phenotypic implications of these variants by developing, validating and implementing new phenotype algorithms, 3) integrate genetic variants into EMRs to inform clinical care; and 4) create community resources. Included in this study are:  - ~24,000 eMERGE participants from 10 eMERGE III study sites. - Corresponding demographics, body mass index measurements. - Top PheWAS codes generated from a collated list of ICD codes from all study sites.  \\n\\nStudy sites and participants include:\\n\\n**Cincinnati Children&#39;s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC):**<br/> Cincinnati Children&#39;s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) is a not-for-profit hospital and research center pioneering breakthrough treatments, providing outstanding family-centered patient care and training healthcare professionals for the future, and dedicated to improving health and welfare of children and to the shared purpose of discovery and practical application of new genomic information to the ordinary care of children. We bring a comprehensive electronic health record (EPIC), a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 680K patient records, a biobank with &#62;261,000 consents that allow return of results to &#62;84,000 patients and guardians who have provided DNA samples, and hundreds of faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. CCHMC will help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify genes for the eMERGE III targeted sequencing panel, provide 3,000 DNA samples from CCHMC patients to be sequenced, review targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis. We will also extend our work generating phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods to many new childhood diseases. We will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, and develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning sequencing results. \\n\\n**Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP):**<br/> The Center for Applied Genomics (CAG) is a specialized Center of Emphasis at the Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), and one of the world&#39;s largest genetics research programs, with to state-of-the-art high-throughput sequencing and genotyping technology. Our primary goal is to translate basic research findings to medical innovations. We aim to develop new and better ways to diagnose and treat children affected by rare and complex medical disorders, including asthma, autism, epilepsy, pediatric cancer, learning disabilities, and a range of rare diseases. Ultimately, our objective is to generate new diagnostic tests and to guide physicians to the most appropriate therapies. Participants were recruited from the CAG biorepository (n&#62;450,000), specifically from &#62;100,000 CHOP pediatric patients and family members, which is enriched for rare-diseases (n&#62;12,000). Center for Applied Genomics, The Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia We gratefully thank all the children and their families who enrolled in this study, and all individuals who donated blood samples for research purposes. Genotyping for this project was performed at the Center for Applied Genomics and supported by an Institutional Development Award from The Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia. Sequencing was supported by the National Institutes of Health through an award from the National Human Genome Research Institute&#39;s Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) program (U01HG008684). \\n\\n**Columbia University:**<br/> The goal of the Columbia eMERGE III project is to develop methods for integrating genomic data in EHRs and to study the impact of such genomic informatics interventions on the health of a diverse, underserved urban adult English- and Spanish-speaking patient population in Northern Manhattan served by Columbia University Medical Center/New York-Presbyterian Hospital system. The study group is 2500 patients recruited from diverse clinics and community outreach centers of self-reported White (~61%), Asian (~11%), African-American (~11%), American Indian/Alaska Native (&#60;1%) racial and Hispanic (~33%) ethnic backgrounds. There are two subgroups in the study cohort - a retrospective group (N=1052) that includes patients from oncology and nephrology clinics, and a prospective one (N=1448) that includes healthy individuals as well as participants with diverse medical conditions. Confirmed pathogenic variants in 70 selected genes will be returned to participants and their healthcare providers through the EHR integration. Participants are able to choose the results they receive and will have the freedom to meet with a genetic counselor and a geneticist to review results. The impact of genetic testing on clinical care is determined by periodic monitoring of EHRs.\\n\\n**Geisinger:**<br/> Samples and phenotype data in this study were provided by the Geisinger MyCode&#174; Community Health Initiative. Participants are recruited across the Geisinger System via online consents or in-person consents at a hospital or clinic visit. Enrollment is ongoing with over 100,000 individuals currently consented.\\n\\n**Partners Healthcare (Harvard University):**<br/> The Partners HealthCare Biobank is a large research program designed to help researchers understand how people&#39;s health is affected by their genes, lifestyle, and environment. This large research data and sample repository provides access to high-quality, consented blood samples to help foster research, advance our understanding of the causes of common diseases, and advance the practice of medicine. For the Partners research community (Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital), the Biobank provides:  - Banked samples (plasma, serum, and DNA) collected from consented patients  - Blood samples that were discarded after clinical testing in the Crimson Cores maintained in the Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital Pathology Departments  - Sample handling and preparation services - Link to the biobank data to the Partners Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) a research instance of our electronic clinical chart - Data access through our research portal.  \\n\\nTo date, over 70,000 Partners patients have given their consent to enroll, give a blood sample, receive research results and agreed to be re-contacted for additional research studies. The Biobank has enabled Partners investigators to compete for nationally recognized grants in personalized medicine such as a clinical electronic Medical Records and Genomics network (eMERGE) site and the national All of US program. The Biobank currently supports over 120 Partners investigators and over 130 million dollars in NIH research. \\n\\n**Kaiser Permanente Washington/ (KPWA) / University of Washington (UW):**<br/> KPWA participants were enrolled in the eMERGE Network through the Northwest Institute of Genetic Medicine (NWIGM) biorepository, and provided the appropriate consent to receive clinically relevant genetic results (N=2,500.) NWIGM is based at the University of Washington and co-managed by the University of Washington and KPWA. The purpose of the NWIGM biorepository is to build infrastructure and resources to carry out a broad range of future genetic research. KPWA members enrolled in the biorepository are asked to provide informed consent to providing a DNA sample for storage in the NWIGM biorepository. The consent is purposefully broad to serve the dual purpose of reducing the burden on researchers who wish to use this biorepository and the IRB committees who will be responsible for reviewing these requests in the future. Participants were eligible if aged 50 - 65 years old at the time of their enrollment into the NWIGM repository, living, enrolled in KPWA&#39;s integrated group practice, and had completed an online Health Risk Appraisal. The selection algorithm was based on several data sources from the EHR at KPWA. 1) Demographics - participants with self-reported race as Asian ancestry were prioritized and selected to enrich for non-European ancestry. The KPWA eMERGE cohort includes N=1,245 members of Asian ancestry. 2) Participants were also selected for a history of colorectal cancer (N=1,255), in order to allow us to enrich germline pathogenic variants. \\n\\n**Mayo Clinic:**<br/> The Return of Actionable Variants Empirical (RAVE) Study was approved by the Mayo Clinic IRB. We recruited 2537 participants from Mayo Clinic biobanks in Rochester, MN, who had hypercholesterolemia or colon polyps, thereby enriching for Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and monogenic causes of colorectal cancer (CRC). Additional eligibility criteria were: 1) residents of Southeast MN who were alive and aged 18-70 years; 2) LDL-C level &#62;155 or &#62;120 mg/dl while on lipid-lowering therapy; 3) no known cause of secondary hyperlipidemia; and 4) no cognitive impairment or dementia that would compromise their ability to give written informed consent. Based on these criteria, we identified 5270 eligible patients and obtained informed consent from 3030 participants. Recruitment was conducted in waves and utilized mailed recruitment packets consisting of a study brochure, a written informed consent form, a baseline psychosocial questionnaire, and a return postage-paid envelope. DNA of 2537 participants was sent for CLIA-certified targeted sequencing of 109 genes including genes associated with FH and CRC. Targeted sequencing and genotyping was performed in a Central Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA)-certified laboratory.\\n\\n**Northwestern University:**<br/> Samples and data used in this study were obtained from patients from Northwestern Medicine, an integrated healthcare system, formed through a partnership of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare and Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Participants include a retrospective cohort from the Northwestern Pharmacogenomics Study, funded through the eMERGE II project, NHGRI (3U01HG006388-02S1) and a prospective cohort from the Genetic Testing and Your Health Study, funded through the eMERGE III project, NHGRI (U01HG008673). Patients were eligible to participate if they were18 years or older and see a physician at Northwestern Medicine. Patients consented to genetic testing and to allow their results to be placed in their electronic medical record.\\n\\n**Vanderbilt University Medical Center:**<br/> Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) participants were enrolled in the eMERGE Network through the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records (VGER) project. Patients were provided the appropriate consent to receive clinically relevant genetic results (N=2,700). Participants were eligible if aged 21 or over, had a healthcare provider at VUMC, and visited the provider at least 3 times in the past 3 years. \\n\\n**Meharry Medical College:**<br/> Inclusion of ethnic groups in genomic research is critical to identify possible reasons for health disparities. African-Americans are being enrolled in various outpatient clinics of Nashville General Hospital at Meharry, an inner city hospital primary serving a poorer patient group. A total of 500 African Americans with four cancer types demonstrating health disparities in this population - prostate, colon, breast, lung are identified and approached by clinical research coordinators. The purpose of the study is to determine if any genetic information can be identified from these patients who have or are at high risk of one of these disparate cancers. All participants provide written informed consent and HIPAA authorization to provide blood samples for broad research use and permission to access data in their hospital electronic medical record for research now and in the future. An extensive demographic profile is obtained and entered into a REDCap database. Blood samples are obtained for a panel of alleles from extracted DNA at Baylor. In addition, de-identified coded samples are processed and stored in a central biorepository for further DNA, RNA and proteomic analyses. The survey and phlebotomy are performed at the time of the initial contact and agreement to participate. Nearly all patients approached willingly agree to participate for potential benefit to themselves, family members, or humankind. Little concern is voiced of providing samples for genetic analysis. Study investigators will share results with the participants and providers if testing does not indicate high risk. Results indicating increased risk or actionable alleles for the patient and/or family will be returned by a genetic counselor. Monitoring of the patients&#39; health in this cohort will continue to be followed in the EMR to identify any future associations that might explain health disparities in African Americans. Proposals will be reviewed from investigators to study the genetic or proteomic samples as well as the clinical and demographic information in the repository.\\n\\nPlease note that this version of the dataset has a handful of mismatches between genotyped and provided sex.

The primary goal of the eMERGE Network is to develop, disseminate, and apply approaches to research that combine biorepositories with electronic medical record (EMR) systems for genomic discovery and genomic medicine implementation research. eMERGE was announced in September 2007 and began its third phase in September 2015. eMERGE III consists of nine study sites, two central sequencing and genotyping facilities, and a coordinating center. eMERGE Phase III aims to: 1) sequence and assess the phenotypic implication of rare variants in a custom designed eMERGEseq panel consisting of 109 genes (including 56 ACMG actionable finding list genes and the top 6 genes from each site relevant to their specific aims), as well as approximately 1400 SNPs; 2) assess the phenotypic implications of these variants by developing, validating and implementing new phenotype algorithms, 3) integrate genetic variants into EMRs to inform clinical care; and 4) create community resources. Included in this study are:  - ~24,000 eMERGE participants from 10 eMERGE III study sites. - Corresponding demographics, body mass index measurements. - Top PheWAS codes generated from a collated list of ICD codes from all study sites.  \\n\\nStudy sites and participants include:\\n\\n**Cincinnati Children&#39;s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC):**<br/> Cincinnati Children&#39;s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) is a not-for-profit hospital and research center pioneering breakthrough treatments, providing outstanding family-centered patient care and training healthcare professionals for the future, and dedicated to improving health and welfare of children and to the shared purpose of discovery and practical application of new genomic information to the ordinary care of children. We bring a comprehensive electronic health record (EPIC), a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 680K patient records, a biobank with &#62;261,000 consents that allow return of results to &#62;84,000 patients and guardians who have provided DNA samples, and hundreds of faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. CCHMC will help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify genes for the eMERGE III targeted sequencing panel, provide 3,000 DNA samples from CCHMC patients to be sequenced, review targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis. We will also extend our work generating phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods to many new childhood diseases. We will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, and develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning sequencing results. \\n\\n**Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP):**<br/> The Center for Applied Genomics (CAG) is a specialized Center of Emphasis at the Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), and one of the world&#39;s largest genetics research programs, with to state-of-the-art high-throughput sequencing and genotyping technology. Our primary goal is to translate basic research findings to medical innovations. We aim to develop new and better ways to diagnose and treat children affected by rare and complex medical disorders, including asthma, autism, epilepsy, pediatric cancer, learning disabilities, and a range of rare diseases. Ultimately, our objective is to generate new diagnostic tests and to guide physicians to the most appropriate therapies. Participants were recruited from the CAG biorepository (n&#62;450,000), specifically from &#62;100,000 CHOP pediatric patients and family members, which is enriched for rare-diseases (n&#62;12,000). Center for Applied Genomics, The Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia We gratefully thank all the children and their families who enrolled in this study, and all individuals who donated blood samples for research purposes. Genotyping for this project was performed at the Center for Applied Genomics and supported by an Institutional Development Award from The Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia. Sequencing was supported by the National Institutes of Health through an award from the National Human Genome Research Institute&#39;s Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) program (U01HG008684). \\n\\n**Columbia University:**<br/> The goal of the Columbia eMERGE III project is to develop methods for integrating genomic data in EHRs and to study the impact of such genomic informatics interventions on the health of a diverse, underserved urban adult English- and Spanish-speaking patient population in Northern Manhattan served by Columbia University Medical Center/New York-Presbyterian Hospital system. The study group is 2500 patients recruited from diverse clinics and community outreach centers of self-reported White (~61%), Asian (~11%), African-American (~11%), American Indian/Alaska Native (&#60;1%) racial and Hispanic (~33%) ethnic backgrounds. There are two subgroups in the study cohort - a retrospective group (N=1052) that includes patients from oncology and nephrology clinics, and a prospective one (N=1448) that includes healthy individuals as well as participants with diverse medical conditions. Confirmed pathogenic variants in 70 selected genes will be returned to participants and their healthcare providers through the EHR integration. Participants are able to choose the results they receive and will have the freedom to meet with a genetic counselor and a geneticist to review results. The impact of genetic testing on clinical care is determined by periodic monitoring of EHRs.\\n\\n**Geisinger:**<br/> Samples and phenotype data in this study were provided by the Geisinger MyCode&#174; Community Health Initiative. Participants are recruited across the Geisinger System via online consents or in-person consents at a hospital or clinic visit. Enrollment is ongoing with over 100,000 individuals currently consented.\\n\\n**Partners Healthcare (Harvard University):**<br/> The Partners HealthCare Biobank is a large research program designed to help researchers understand how people&#39;s health is affected by their genes, lifestyle, and environment. This large research data and sample repository provides access to high-quality, consented blood samples to help foster research, advance our understanding of the causes of common diseases, and advance the practice of medicine. For the Partners research community (Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital), the Biobank provides:  - Banked samples (plasma, serum, and DNA) collected from consented patients  - Blood samples that were discarded after clinical testing in the Crimson Cores maintained in the Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital Pathology Departments  - Sample handling and preparation services - Link to the biobank data to the Partners Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) a research instance of our electronic clinical chart - Data access through our research portal.  \\n\\nTo date, over 70,000 Partners patients have given their consent to enroll, give a blood sample, receive research results and agreed to be re-contacted for additional research studies. The Biobank has enabled Partners investigators to compete for nationally recognized grants in personalized medicine such as a clinical electronic Medical Records and Genomics network (eMERGE) site and the national All of US program. The Biobank currently supports over 120 Partners investigators and over 130 million dollars in NIH research. \\n\\n**Kaiser Permanente Washington/ (KPWA) / University of Washington (UW):**<br/> KPWA participants were enrolled in the eMERGE Network through the Northwest Institute of Genetic Medicine (NWIGM) biorepository, and provided the appropriate consent to receive clinically relevant genetic results (N=2,500.) NWIGM is based at the University of Washington and co-managed by the University of Washington and KPWA. The purpose of the NWIGM biorepository is to build infrastructure and resources to carry out a broad range of future genetic research. KPWA members enrolled in the biorepository are asked to provide informed consent to providing a DNA sample for storage in the NWIGM biorepository. The consent is purposefully broad to serve the dual purpose of reducing the burden on researchers who wish to use this biorepository and the IRB committees who will be responsible for reviewing these requests in the future. Participants were eligible if aged 50 - 65 years old at the time of their enrollment into the NWIGM repository, living, enrolled in KPWA&#39;s integrated group practice, and had completed an online Health Risk Appraisal. The selection algorithm was based on several data sources from the EHR at KPWA. 1) Demographics - participants with self-reported race as Asian ancestry were prioritized and selected to enrich for non-European ancestry. The KPWA eMERGE cohort includes N=1,245 members of Asian ancestry. 2) Participants were also selected for a history of colorectal cancer (N=1,255), in order to allow us to enrich germline pathogenic variants. \\n\\n**Mayo Clinic:**<br/> The Return of Actionable Variants Empirical (RAVE) Study was approved by the Mayo Clinic IRB. We recruited 2537 participants from Mayo Clinic biobanks in Rochester, MN, who had hypercholesterolemia or colon polyps, thereby enriching for Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and monogenic causes of colorectal cancer (CRC). Additional eligibility criteria were: 1) residents of Southeast MN who were alive and aged 18-70 years; 2) LDL-C level &#62;155 or &#62;120 mg/dl while on lipid-lowering therapy; 3) no known cause of secondary hyperlipidemia; and 4) no cognitive impairment or dementia that would compromise their ability to give written informed consent. Based on these criteria, we identified 5270 eligible patients and obtained informed consent from 3030 participants. Recruitment was conducted in waves and utilized mailed recruitment packets consisting of a study brochure, a written informed consent form, a baseline psychosocial questionnaire, and a return postage-paid envelope. DNA of 2537 participants was sent for CLIA-certified targeted sequencing of 109 genes including genes associated with FH and CRC. Targeted sequencing and genotyping was performed in a Central Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA)-certified laboratory.\\n\\n**Northwestern University:**<br/> Samples and data used in this study were obtained from patients from Northwestern Medicine, an integrated healthcare system, formed through a partnership of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare and Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Participants include a retrospective cohort from the Northwestern Pharmacogenomics Study, funded through the eMERGE II project, NHGRI (3U01HG006388-02S1) and a prospective cohort from the Genetic Testing and Your Health Study, funded through the eMERGE III project, NHGRI (U01HG008673). Patients were eligible to participate if they were18 years or older and see a physician at Northwestern Medicine. Patients consented to genetic testing and to allow their results to be placed in their electronic medical record.\\n\\n**Vanderbilt University Medical Center:**<br/> Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) participants were enrolled in the eMERGE Network through the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records (VGER) project. Patients were provided the appropriate consent to receive clinically relevant genetic results (N=2,700). Participants were eligible if aged 21 or over, had a healthcare provider at VUMC, and visited the provider at least 3 times in the past 3 years. \\n\\n**Meharry Medical College:**<br/> Inclusion of ethnic groups in genomic research is critical to identify possible reasons for health disparities. African-Americans are being enrolled in various outpatient clinics of Nashville General Hospital at Meharry, an inner city hospital primary serving a poorer patient group. A total of 500 African Americans with four cancer types demonstrating health disparities in this population - prostate, colon, breast, lung are identified and approached by clinical research coordinators. The purpose of the study is to determine if any genetic information can be identified from these patients who have or are at high risk of one of these disparate cancers. All participants provide written informed consent and HIPAA authorization to provide blood samples for broad research use and permission to access data in their hospital electronic medical record for research now and in the future. An extensive demographic profile is obtained and entered into a REDCap database. Blood samples are obtained for a panel of alleles from extracted DNA at Baylor. In addition, de-identified coded samples are processed and stored in a central biorepository for further DNA, RNA and proteomic analyses. The survey and phlebotomy are performed at the time of the initial contact and agreement to participate. Nearly all patients approached willingly agree to participate for potential benefit to themselves, family members, or humankind. Little concern is voiced of providing samples for genetic analysis. Study investigators will share results with the participants and providers if testing does not indicate high risk. Results indicating increased risk or actionable alleles for the patient and/or family will be returned by a genetic counselor. Monitoring of the patients&#39; health in this cohort will continue to be followed in the EMR to identify any future associations that might explain health disparities in African Americans. Proposals will be reviewed from investigators to study the genetic or proteomic samples as well as the clinical and demographic information in the repository.\\n\\nPlease note that this version of the dataset has a handful of mismatches between genotyped and provided sex.

The primary goal of the eMERGE Network is to develop, disseminate, and apply approaches to research that combine biorepositories with electronic medical record (EMR) systems for genomic discovery and genomic medicine implementation research. eMERGE was announced in September 2007 and began its third phase in September 2015. eMERGE III consists of nine study sites, two central sequencing and genotyping facilities, and a coordinating center. eMERGE Phase III aims to: 1) sequence and assess the phenotypic implication of rare variants in a custom designed eMERGEseq panel consisting of 109 genes (including 56 ACMG actionable finding list genes and the top 6 genes from each site relevant to their specific aims), as well as approximately 1400 SNPs; 2) assess the phenotypic implications of these variants by developing, validating and implementing new phenotype algorithms, 3) integrate genetic variants into EMRs to inform clinical care; and 4) create community resources. Included in this study are:  - ~24,000 eMERGE participants from 10 eMERGE III study sites. - Corresponding demographics, body mass index measurements. - Top PheWAS codes generated from a collated list of ICD codes from all study sites.  \\n\\nStudy sites and participants include:\\n\\n**Cincinnati Children&#39;s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC):**<br/> Cincinnati Children&#39;s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) is a not-for-profit hospital and research center pioneering breakthrough treatments, providing outstanding family-centered patient care and training healthcare professionals for the future, and dedicated to improving health and welfare of children and to the shared purpose of discovery and practical application of new genomic information to the ordinary care of children. We bring a comprehensive electronic health record (EPIC), a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 680K patient records, a biobank with &#62;261,000 consents that allow return of results to &#62;84,000 patients and guardians who have provided DNA samples, and hundreds of faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. CCHMC will help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify genes for the eMERGE III targeted sequencing panel, provide 3,000 DNA samples from CCHMC patients to be sequenced, review targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis. We will also extend our work generating phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods to many new childhood diseases. We will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, and develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning sequencing results. \\n\\n**Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP):**<br/> The Center for Applied Genomics (CAG) is a specialized Center of Emphasis at the Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), and one of the world&#39;s largest genetics research programs, with to state-of-the-art high-throughput sequencing and genotyping technology. Our primary goal is to translate basic research findings to medical innovations. We aim to develop new and better ways to diagnose and treat children affected by rare and complex medical disorders, including asthma, autism, epilepsy, pediatric cancer, learning disabilities, and a range of rare diseases. Ultimately, our objective is to generate new diagnostic tests and to guide physicians to the most appropriate therapies. Participants were recruited from the CAG biorepository (n&#62;450,000), specifically from &#62;100,000 CHOP pediatric patients and family members, which is enriched for rare-diseases (n&#62;12,000). Center for Applied Genomics, The Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia We gratefully thank all the children and their families who enrolled in this study, and all individuals who donated blood samples for research purposes. Genotyping for this project was performed at the Center for Applied Genomics and supported by an Institutional Development Award from The Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia. Sequencing was supported by the National Institutes of Health through an award from the National Human Genome Research Institute&#39;s Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) program (U01HG008684). \\n\\n**Columbia University:**<br/> The goal of the Columbia eMERGE III project is to develop methods for integrating genomic data in EHRs and to study the impact of such genomic informatics interventions on the health of a diverse, underserved urban adult English- and Spanish-speaking patient population in Northern Manhattan served by Columbia University Medical Center/New York-Presbyterian Hospital system. The study group is 2500 patients recruited from diverse clinics and community outreach centers of self-reported White (~61%), Asian (~11%), African-American (~11%), American Indian/Alaska Native (&#60;1%) racial and Hispanic (~33%) ethnic backgrounds. There are two subgroups in the study cohort - a retrospective group (N=1052) that includes patients from oncology and nephrology clinics, and a prospective one (N=1448) that includes healthy individuals as well as participants with diverse medical conditions. Confirmed pathogenic variants in 70 selected genes will be returned to participants and their healthcare providers through the EHR integration. Participants are able to choose the results they receive and will have the freedom to meet with a genetic counselor and a geneticist to review results. The impact of genetic testing on clinical care is determined by periodic monitoring of EHRs.\\n\\n**Geisinger:**<br/> Samples and phenotype data in this study were provided by the Geisinger MyCode&#174; Community Health Initiative. Participants are recruited across the Geisinger System via online consents or in-person consents at a hospital or clinic visit. Enrollment is ongoing with over 100,000 individuals currently consented.\\n\\n**Partners Healthcare (Harvard University):**<br/> The Partners HealthCare Biobank is a large research program designed to help researchers understand how people&#39;s health is affected by their genes, lifestyle, and environment. This large research data and sample repository provides access to high-quality, consented blood samples to help foster research, advance our understanding of the causes of common diseases, and advance the practice of medicine. For the Partners research community (Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital), the Biobank provides:  - Banked samples (plasma, serum, and DNA) collected from consented patients  - Blood samples that were discarded after clinical testing in the Crimson Cores maintained in the Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital Pathology Departments  - Sample handling and preparation services - Link to the biobank data to the Partners Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) a research instance of our electronic clinical chart - Data access through our research portal.  \\n\\nTo date, over 70,000 Partners patients have given their consent to enroll, give a blood sample, receive research results and agreed to be re-contacted for additional research studies. The Biobank has enabled Partners investigators to compete for nationally recognized grants in personalized medicine such as a clinical electronic Medical Records and Genomics network (eMERGE) site and the national All of US program. The Biobank currently supports over 120 Partners investigators and over 130 million dollars in NIH research. \\n\\n**Kaiser Permanente Washington/ (KPWA) / University of Washington (UW):**<br/> KPWA participants were enrolled in the eMERGE Network through the Northwest Institute of Genetic Medicine (NWIGM) biorepository, and provided the appropriate consent to receive clinically relevant genetic results (N=2,500.) NWIGM is based at the University of Washington and co-managed by the University of Washington and KPWA. The purpose of the NWIGM biorepository is to build infrastructure and resources to carry out a broad range of future genetic research. KPWA members enrolled in the biorepository are asked to provide informed consent to providing a DNA sample for storage in the NWIGM biorepository. The consent is purposefully broad to serve the dual purpose of reducing the burden on researchers who wish to use this biorepository and the IRB committees who will be responsible for reviewing these requests in the future. Participants were eligible if aged 50 - 65 years old at the time of their enrollment into the NWIGM repository, living, enrolled in KPWA&#39;s integrated group practice, and had completed an online Health Risk Appraisal. The selection algorithm was based on several data sources from the EHR at KPWA. 1) Demographics - participants with self-reported race as Asian ancestry were prioritized and selected to enrich for non-European ancestry. The KPWA eMERGE cohort includes N=1,245 members of Asian ancestry. 2) Participants were also selected for a history of colorectal cancer (N=1,255), in order to allow us to enrich germline pathogenic variants. \\n\\n**Mayo Clinic:**<br/> The Return of Actionable Variants Empirical (RAVE) Study was approved by the Mayo Clinic IRB. We recruited 2537 participants from Mayo Clinic biobanks in Rochester, MN, who had hypercholesterolemia or colon polyps, thereby enriching for Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and monogenic causes of colorectal cancer (CRC). Additional eligibility criteria were: 1) residents of Southeast MN who were alive and aged 18-70 years; 2) LDL-C level &#62;155 or &#62;120 mg/dl while on lipid-lowering therapy; 3) no known cause of secondary hyperlipidemia; and 4) no cognitive impairment or dementia that would compromise their ability to give written informed consent. Based on these criteria, we identified 5270 eligible patients and obtained informed consent from 3030 participants. Recruitment was conducted in waves and utilized mailed recruitment packets consisting of a study brochure, a written informed consent form, a baseline psychosocial questionnaire, and a return postage-paid envelope. DNA of 2537 participants was sent for CLIA-certified targeted sequencing of 109 genes including genes associated with FH and CRC. Targeted sequencing and genotyping was performed in a Central Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA)-certified laboratory.\\n\\n**Northwestern University:**<br/> Samples and data used in this study were obtained from patients from Northwestern Medicine, an integrated healthcare system, formed through a partnership of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare and Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Participants include a retrospective cohort from the Northwestern Pharmacogenomics Study, funded through the eMERGE II project, NHGRI (3U01HG006388-02S1) and a prospective cohort from the Genetic Testing and Your Health Study, funded through the eMERGE III project, NHGRI (U01HG008673). Patients were eligible to participate if they were18 years or older and see a physician at Northwestern Medicine. Patients consented to genetic testing and to allow their results to be placed in their electronic medical record.\\n\\n**Vanderbilt University Medical Center:**<br/> Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) participants were enrolled in the eMERGE Network through the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records (VGER) project. Patients were provided the appropriate consent to receive clinically relevant genetic results (N=2,700). Participants were eligible if aged 21 or over, had a healthcare provider at VUMC, and visited the provider at least 3 times in the past 3 years. \\n\\n**Meharry Medical College:**<br/> Inclusion of ethnic groups in genomic research is critical to identify possible reasons for health disparities. African-Americans are being enrolled in various outpatient clinics of Nashville General Hospital at Meharry, an inner city hospital primary serving a poorer patient group. A total of 500 African Americans with four cancer types demonstrating health disparities in this population - prostate, colon, breast, lung are identified and approached by clinical research coordinators. The purpose of the study is to determine if any genetic information can be identified from these patients who have or are at high risk of one of these disparate cancers. All participants provide written informed consent and HIPAA authorization to provide blood samples for broad research use and permission to access data in their hospital electronic medical record for research now and in the future. An extensive demographic profile is obtained and entered into a REDCap database. Blood samples are obtained for a panel of alleles from extracted DNA at Baylor. In addition, de-identified coded samples are processed and stored in a central biorepository for further DNA, RNA and proteomic analyses. The survey and phlebotomy are performed at the time of the initial contact and agreement to participate. Nearly all patients approached willingly agree to participate for potential benefit to themselves, family members, or humankind. Little concern is voiced of providing samples for genetic analysis. Study investigators will share results with the participants and providers if testing does not indicate high risk. Results indicating increased risk or actionable alleles for the patient and/or family will be returned by a genetic counselor. Monitoring of the patients&#39; health in this cohort will continue to be followed in the EMR to identify any future associations that might explain health disparities in African Americans. Proposals will be reviewed from investigators to study the genetic or proteomic samples as well as the clinical and demographic information in the repository.\\n\\nPlease note that this version of the dataset has a handful of mismatches between genotyped and provided sex.

The primary goal of the eMERGE Network is to develop, disseminate, and apply approaches to research that combine biorepositories with electronic medical record (EMR) systems for genomic discovery and genomic medicine implementation research. eMERGE was announced in September 2007 and began its third phase in September 2015. eMERGE III consists of nine study sites, two central sequencing and genotyping facilities, and a coordinating center. eMERGE Phase III aims to: 1) sequence and assess the phenotypic implication of rare variants in a custom designed eMERGEseq panel consisting of 109 genes (including 56 ACMG actionable finding list genes and the top 6 genes from each site relevant to their specific aims), as well as approximately 1400 SNPs; 2) assess the phenotypic implications of these variants by developing, validating and implementing new phenotype algorithms, 3) integrate genetic variants into EMRs to inform clinical care; and 4) create community resources. Included in this study are:  - ~24,000 eMERGE participants from 10 eMERGE III study sites. - Corresponding demographics, body mass index measurements. - Top PheWAS codes generated from a collated list of ICD codes from all study sites.  \\n\\nStudy sites and participants include:\\n\\n**Cincinnati Children&#39;s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC):**<br/> Cincinnati Children&#39;s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) is a not-for-profit hospital and research center pioneering breakthrough treatments, providing outstanding family-centered patient care and training healthcare professionals for the future, and dedicated to improving health and welfare of children and to the shared purpose of discovery and practical application of new genomic information to the ordinary care of children. We bring a comprehensive electronic health record (EPIC), a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 680K patient records, a biobank with &#62;261,000 consents that allow return of results to &#62;84,000 patients and guardians who have provided DNA samples, and hundreds of faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. CCHMC will help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify genes for the eMERGE III targeted sequencing panel, provide 3,000 DNA samples from CCHMC patients to be sequenced, review targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis. We will also extend our work generating phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods to many new childhood diseases. We will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, and develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning sequencing results. \\n\\n**Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP):**<br/> The Center for Applied Genomics (CAG) is a specialized Center of Emphasis at the Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), and one of the world&#39;s largest genetics research programs, with to state-of-the-art high-throughput sequencing and genotyping technology. Our primary goal is to translate basic research findings to medical innovations. We aim to develop new and better ways to diagnose and treat children affected by rare and complex medical disorders, including asthma, autism, epilepsy, pediatric cancer, learning disabilities, and a range of rare diseases. Ultimately, our objective is to generate new diagnostic tests and to guide physicians to the most appropriate therapies. Participants were recruited from the CAG biorepository (n&#62;450,000), specifically from &#62;100,000 CHOP pediatric patients and family members, which is enriched for rare-diseases (n&#62;12,000). Center for Applied Genomics, The Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia We gratefully thank all the children and their families who enrolled in this study, and all individuals who donated blood samples for research purposes. Genotyping for this project was performed at the Center for Applied Genomics and supported by an Institutional Development Award from The Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia. Sequencing was supported by the National Institutes of Health through an award from the National Human Genome Research Institute&#39;s Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) program (U01HG008684). \\n\\n**Columbia University:**<br/> The goal of the Columbia eMERGE III project is to develop methods for integrating genomic data in EHRs and to study the impact of such genomic informatics interventions on the health of a diverse, underserved urban adult English- and Spanish-speaking patient population in Northern Manhattan served by Columbia University Medical Center/New York-Presbyterian Hospital system. The study group is 2500 patients recruited from diverse clinics and community outreach centers of self-reported White (~61%), Asian (~11%), African-American (~11%), American Indian/Alaska Native (&#60;1%) racial and Hispanic (~33%) ethnic backgrounds. There are two subgroups in the study cohort - a retrospective group (N=1052) that includes patients from oncology and nephrology clinics, and a prospective one (N=1448) that includes healthy individuals as well as participants with diverse medical conditions. Confirmed pathogenic variants in 70 selected genes will be returned to participants and their healthcare providers through the EHR integration. Participants are able to choose the results they receive and will have the freedom to meet with a genetic counselor and a geneticist to review results. The impact of genetic testing on clinical care is determined by periodic monitoring of EHRs.\\n\\n**Geisinger:**<br/> Samples and phenotype data in this study were provided by the Geisinger MyCode&#174; Community Health Initiative. Participants are recruited across the Geisinger System via online consents or in-person consents at a hospital or clinic visit. Enrollment is ongoing with over 100,000 individuals currently consented.\\n\\n**Partners Healthcare (Harvard University):**<br/> The Partners HealthCare Biobank is a large research program designed to help researchers understand how people&#39;s health is affected by their genes, lifestyle, and environment. This large research data and sample repository provides access to high-quality, consented blood samples to help foster research, advance our understanding of the causes of common diseases, and advance the practice of medicine. For the Partners research community (Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital), the Biobank provides:  - Banked samples (plasma, serum, and DNA) collected from consented patients  - Blood samples that were discarded after clinical testing in the Crimson Cores maintained in the Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital Pathology Departments  - Sample handling and preparation services - Link to the biobank data to the Partners Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) a research instance of our electronic clinical chart - Data access through our research portal.  \\n\\nTo date, over 70,000 Partners patients have given their consent to enroll, give a blood sample, receive research results and agreed to be re-contacted for additional research studies. The Biobank has enabled Partners investigators to compete for nationally recognized grants in personalized medicine such as a clinical electronic Medical Records and Genomics network (eMERGE) site and the national All of US program. The Biobank currently supports over 120 Partners investigators and over 130 million dollars in NIH research. \\n\\n**Kaiser Permanente Washington/ (KPWA) / University of Washington (UW):**<br/> KPWA participants were enrolled in the eMERGE Network through the Northwest Institute of Genetic Medicine (NWIGM) biorepository, and provided the appropriate consent to receive clinically relevant genetic results (N=2,500.) NWIGM is based at the University of Washington and co-managed by the University of Washington and KPWA. The purpose of the NWIGM biorepository is to build infrastructure and resources to carry out a broad range of future genetic research. KPWA members enrolled in the biorepository are asked to provide informed consent to providing a DNA sample for storage in the NWIGM biorepository. The consent is purposefully broad to serve the dual purpose of reducing the burden on researchers who wish to use this biorepository and the IRB committees who will be responsible for reviewing these requests in the future. Participants were eligible if aged 50 - 65 years old at the time of their enrollment into the NWIGM repository, living, enrolled in KPWA&#39;s integrated group practice, and had completed an online Health Risk Appraisal. The selection algorithm was based on several data sources from the EHR at KPWA. 1) Demographics - participants with self-reported race as Asian ancestry were prioritized and selected to enrich for non-European ancestry. The KPWA eMERGE cohort includes N=1,245 members of Asian ancestry. 2) Participants were also selected for a history of colorectal cancer (N=1,255), in order to allow us to enrich germline pathogenic variants. \\n\\n**Mayo Clinic:**<br/> The Return of Actionable Variants Empirical (RAVE) Study was approved by the Mayo Clinic IRB. We recruited 2537 participants from Mayo Clinic biobanks in Rochester, MN, who had hypercholesterolemia or colon polyps, thereby enriching for Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and monogenic causes of colorectal cancer (CRC). Additional eligibility criteria were: 1) residents of Southeast MN who were alive and aged 18-70 years; 2) LDL-C level &#62;155 or &#62;120 mg/dl while on lipid-lowering therapy; 3) no known cause of secondary hyperlipidemia; and 4) no cognitive impairment or dementia that would compromise their ability to give written informed consent. Based on these criteria, we identified 5270 eligible patients and obtained informed consent from 3030 participants. Recruitment was conducted in waves and utilized mailed recruitment packets consisting of a study brochure, a written informed consent form, a baseline psychosocial questionnaire, and a return postage-paid envelope. DNA of 2537 participants was sent for CLIA-certified targeted sequencing of 109 genes including genes associated with FH and CRC. Targeted sequencing and genotyping was performed in a Central Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA)-certified laboratory.\\n\\n**Northwestern University:**<br/> Samples and data used in this study were obtained from patients from Northwestern Medicine, an integrated healthcare system, formed through a partnership of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare and Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Participants include a retrospective cohort from the Northwestern Pharmacogenomics Study, funded through the eMERGE II project, NHGRI (3U01HG006388-02S1) and a prospective cohort from the Genetic Testing and Your Health Study, funded through the eMERGE III project, NHGRI (U01HG008673). Patients were eligible to participate if they were18 years or older and see a physician at Northwestern Medicine. Patients consented to genetic testing and to allow their results to be placed in their electronic medical record.\\n\\n**Vanderbilt University Medical Center:**<br/> Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) participants were enrolled in the eMERGE Network through the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records (VGER) project. Patients were provided the appropriate consent to receive clinically relevant genetic results (N=2,700). Participants were eligible if aged 21 or over, had a healthcare provider at VUMC, and visited the provider at least 3 times in the past 3 years. \\n\\n**Meharry Medical College:**<br/> Inclusion of ethnic groups in genomic research is critical to identify possible reasons for health disparities. African-Americans are being enrolled in various outpatient clinics of Nashville General Hospital at Meharry, an inner city hospital primary serving a poorer patient group. A total of 500 African Americans with four cancer types demonstrating health disparities in this population - prostate, colon, breast, lung are identified and approached by clinical research coordinators. The purpose of the study is to determine if any genetic information can be identified from these patients who have or are at high risk of one of these disparate cancers. All participants provide written informed consent and HIPAA authorization to provide blood samples for broad research use and permission to access data in their hospital electronic medical record for research now and in the future. An extensive demographic profile is obtained and entered into a REDCap database. Blood samples are obtained for a panel of alleles from extracted DNA at Baylor. In addition, de-identified coded samples are processed and stored in a central biorepository for further DNA, RNA and proteomic analyses. The survey and phlebotomy are performed at the time of the initial contact and agreement to participate. Nearly all patients approached willingly agree to participate for potential benefit to themselves, family members, or humankind. Little concern is voiced of providing samples for genetic analysis. Study investigators will share results with the participants and providers if testing does not indicate high risk. Results indicating increased risk or actionable alleles for the patient and/or family will be returned by a genetic counselor. Monitoring of the patients&#39; health in this cohort will continue to be followed in the EMR to identify any future associations that might explain health disparities in African Americans. Proposals will be reviewed from investigators to study the genetic or proteomic samples as well as the clinical and demographic information in the repository.\\n\\nPlease note that this version of the dataset has a handful of mismatches between genotyped and provided sex.

The primary goal of the eMERGE Network is to develop, disseminate, and apply approaches to research that combine biorepositories with electronic medical record (EMR) systems for genomic discovery and genomic medicine implementation research. eMERGE was announced in September 2007 and began its third phase in September 2015. eMERGE III consists of nine study sites, two central sequencing and genotyping facilities, and a coordinating center. eMERGE Phase III aims to: 1) sequence and assess the phenotypic implication of rare variants in a custom designed eMERGEseq panel consisting of 109 genes (including 56 ACMG actionable finding list genes and the top 6 genes from each site relevant to their specific aims), as well as approximately 1400 SNPs; 2) assess the phenotypic implications of these variants by developing, validating and implementing new phenotype algorithms, 3) integrate genetic variants into EMRs to inform clinical care; and 4) create community resources. Included in this study are:  - ~24,000 eMERGE participants from 10 eMERGE III study sites. - Corresponding demographics, body mass index measurements. - Top PheWAS codes generated from a collated list of ICD codes from all study sites.  \\n\\nStudy sites and participants include:\\n\\n**Cincinnati Children&#39;s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC):**<br/> Cincinnati Children&#39;s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) is a not-for-profit hospital and research center pioneering breakthrough treatments, providing outstanding family-centered patient care and training healthcare professionals for the future, and dedicated to improving health and welfare of children and to the shared purpose of discovery and practical application of new genomic information to the ordinary care of children. We bring a comprehensive electronic health record (EPIC), a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 680K patient records, a biobank with &#62;261,000 consents that allow return of results to &#62;84,000 patients and guardians who have provided DNA samples, and hundreds of faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. CCHMC will help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify genes for the eMERGE III targeted sequencing panel, provide 3,000 DNA samples from CCHMC patients to be sequenced, review targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis. We will also extend our work generating phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods to many new childhood diseases. We will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, and develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning sequencing results. \\n\\n**Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP):**<br/> The Center for Applied Genomics (CAG) is a specialized Center of Emphasis at the Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), and one of the world&#39;s largest genetics research programs, with to state-of-the-art high-throughput sequencing and genotyping technology. Our primary goal is to translate basic research findings to medical innovations. We aim to develop new and better ways to diagnose and treat children affected by rare and complex medical disorders, including asthma, autism, epilepsy, pediatric cancer, learning disabilities, and a range of rare diseases. Ultimately, our objective is to generate new diagnostic tests and to guide physicians to the most appropriate therapies. Participants were recruited from the CAG biorepository (n&#62;450,000), specifically from &#62;100,000 CHOP pediatric patients and family members, which is enriched for rare-diseases (n&#62;12,000). Center for Applied Genomics, The Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia We gratefully thank all the children and their families who enrolled in this study, and all individuals who donated blood samples for research purposes. Genotyping for this project was performed at the Center for Applied Genomics and supported by an Institutional Development Award from The Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia. Sequencing was supported by the National Institutes of Health through an award from the National Human Genome Research Institute&#39;s Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) program (U01HG008684). \\n\\n**Columbia University:**<br/> The goal of the Columbia eMERGE III project is to develop methods for integrating genomic data in EHRs and to study the impact of such genomic informatics interventions on the health of a diverse, underserved urban adult English- and Spanish-speaking patient population in Northern Manhattan served by Columbia University Medical Center/New York-Presbyterian Hospital system. The study group is 2500 patients recruited from diverse clinics and community outreach centers of self-reported White (~61%), Asian (~11%), African-American (~11%), American Indian/Alaska Native (&#60;1%) racial and Hispanic (~33%) ethnic backgrounds. There are two subgroups in the study cohort - a retrospective group (N=1052) that includes patients from oncology and nephrology clinics, and a prospective one (N=1448) that includes healthy individuals as well as participants with diverse medical conditions. Confirmed pathogenic variants in 70 selected genes will be returned to participants and their healthcare providers through the EHR integration. Participants are able to choose the results they receive and will have the freedom to meet with a genetic counselor and a geneticist to review results. The impact of genetic testing on clinical care is determined by periodic monitoring of EHRs.\\n\\n**Geisinger:**<br/> Samples and phenotype data in this study were provided by the Geisinger MyCode&#174; Community Health Initiative. Participants are recruited across the Geisinger System via online consents or in-person consents at a hospital or clinic visit. Enrollment is ongoing with over 100,000 individuals currently consented.\\n\\n**Partners Healthcare (Harvard University):**<br/> The Partners HealthCare Biobank is a large research program designed to help researchers understand how people&#39;s health is affected by their genes, lifestyle, and environment. This large research data and sample repository provides access to high-quality, consented blood samples to help foster research, advance our understanding of the causes of common diseases, and advance the practice of medicine. For the Partners research community (Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital), the Biobank provides:  - Banked samples (plasma, serum, and DNA) collected from consented patients  - Blood samples that were discarded after clinical testing in the Crimson Cores maintained in the Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital Pathology Departments  - Sample handling and preparation services - Link to the biobank data to the Partners Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) a research instance of our electronic clinical chart - Data access through our research portal.  \\n\\nTo date, over 70,000 Partners patients have given their consent to enroll, give a blood sample, receive research results and agreed to be re-contacted for additional research studies. The Biobank has enabled Partners investigators to compete for nationally recognized grants in personalized medicine such as a clinical electronic Medical Records and Genomics network (eMERGE) site and the national All of US program. The Biobank currently supports over 120 Partners investigators and over 130 million dollars in NIH research. \\n\\n**Kaiser Permanente Washington/ (KPWA) / University of Washington (UW):**<br/> KPWA participants were enrolled in the eMERGE Network through the Northwest Institute of Genetic Medicine (NWIGM) biorepository, and provided the appropriate consent to receive clinically relevant genetic results (N=2,500.) NWIGM is based at the University of Washington and co-managed by the University of Washington and KPWA. The purpose of the NWIGM biorepository is to build infrastructure and resources to carry out a broad range of future genetic research. KPWA members enrolled in the biorepository are asked to provide informed consent to providing a DNA sample for storage in the NWIGM biorepository. The consent is purposefully broad to serve the dual purpose of reducing the burden on researchers who wish to use this biorepository and the IRB committees who will be responsible for reviewing these requests in the future. Participants were eligible if aged 50 - 65 years old at the time of their enrollment into the NWIGM repository, living, enrolled in KPWA&#39;s integrated group practice, and had completed an online Health Risk Appraisal. The selection algorithm was based on several data sources from the EHR at KPWA. 1) Demographics - participants with self-reported race as Asian ancestry were prioritized and selected to enrich for non-European ancestry. The KPWA eMERGE cohort includes N=1,245 members of Asian ancestry. 2) Participants were also selected for a history of colorectal cancer (N=1,255), in order to allow us to enrich germline pathogenic variants. \\n\\n**Mayo Clinic:**<br/> The Return of Actionable Variants Empirical (RAVE) Study was approved by the Mayo Clinic IRB. We recruited 2537 participants from Mayo Clinic biobanks in Rochester, MN, who had hypercholesterolemia or colon polyps, thereby enriching for Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and monogenic causes of colorectal cancer (CRC). Additional eligibility criteria were: 1) residents of Southeast MN who were alive and aged 18-70 years; 2) LDL-C level &#62;155 or &#62;120 mg/dl while on lipid-lowering therapy; 3) no known cause of secondary hyperlipidemia; and 4) no cognitive impairment or dementia that would compromise their ability to give written informed consent. Based on these criteria, we identified 5270 eligible patients and obtained informed consent from 3030 participants. Recruitment was conducted in waves and utilized mailed recruitment packets consisting of a study brochure, a written informed consent form, a baseline psychosocial questionnaire, and a return postage-paid envelope. DNA of 2537 participants was sent for CLIA-certified targeted sequencing of 109 genes including genes associated with FH and CRC. Targeted sequencing and genotyping was performed in a Central Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA)-certified laboratory.\\n\\n**Northwestern University:**<br/> Samples and data used in this study were obtained from patients from Northwestern Medicine, an integrated healthcare system, formed through a partnership of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare and Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Participants include a retrospective cohort from the Northwestern Pharmacogenomics Study, funded through the eMERGE II project, NHGRI (3U01HG006388-02S1) and a prospective cohort from the Genetic Testing and Your Health Study, funded through the eMERGE III project, NHGRI (U01HG008673). Patients were eligible to participate if they were18 years or older and see a physician at Northwestern Medicine. Patients consented to genetic testing and to allow their results to be placed in their electronic medical record.\\n\\n**Vanderbilt University Medical Center:**<br/> Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) participants were enrolled in the eMERGE Network through the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records (VGER) project. Patients were provided the appropriate consent to receive clinically relevant genetic results (N=2,700). Participants were eligible if aged 21 or over, had a healthcare provider at VUMC, and visited the provider at least 3 times in the past 3 years. \\n\\n**Meharry Medical College:**<br/> Inclusion of ethnic groups in genomic research is critical to identify possible reasons for health disparities. African-Americans are being enrolled in various outpatient clinics of Nashville General Hospital at Meharry, an inner city hospital primary serving a poorer patient group. A total of 500 African Americans with four cancer types demonstrating health disparities in this population - prostate, colon, breast, lung are identified and approached by clinical research coordinators. The purpose of the study is to determine if any genetic information can be identified from these patients who have or are at high risk of one of these disparate cancers. All participants provide written informed consent and HIPAA authorization to provide blood samples for broad research use and permission to access data in their hospital electronic medical record for research now and in the future. An extensive demographic profile is obtained and entered into a REDCap database. Blood samples are obtained for a panel of alleles from extracted DNA at Baylor. In addition, de-identified coded samples are processed and stored in a central biorepository for further DNA, RNA and proteomic analyses. The survey and phlebotomy are performed at the time of the initial contact and agreement to participate. Nearly all patients approached willingly agree to participate for potential benefit to themselves, family members, or humankind. Little concern is voiced of providing samples for genetic analysis. Study investigators will share results with the participants and providers if testing does not indicate high risk. Results indicating increased risk or actionable alleles for the patient and/or family will be returned by a genetic counselor. Monitoring of the patients&#39; health in this cohort will continue to be followed in the EMR to identify any future associations that might explain health disparities in African Americans. Proposals will be reviewed from investigators to study the genetic or proteomic samples as well as the clinical and demographic information in the repository.\\n\\nPlease note that this version of the dataset has a handful of mismatches between genotyped and provided sex.

The primary goal of the eMERGE Network is to develop, disseminate, and apply approaches to research that combine biorepositories with electronic medical record (EMR) systems for genomic discovery and genomic medicine implementation research. eMERGE was announced in September 2007 and began its third phase in September 2015. eMERGE III consists of nine study sites, two central sequencing and genotyping facilities, and a coordinating center. eMERGE Phase III aims to: 1) sequence and assess the phenotypic implication of rare variants in a custom designed eMERGEseq panel consisting of 109 genes (including 56 ACMG actionable finding list genes and the top 6 genes from each site relevant to their specific aims), as well as approximately 1400 SNPs; 2) assess the phenotypic implications of these variants by developing, validating and implementing new phenotype algorithms, 3) integrate genetic variants into EMRs to inform clinical care; and 4) create community resources. Included in this study are:  - ~24,000 eMERGE participants from 10 eMERGE III study sites. - Corresponding demographics, body mass index measurements. - Top PheWAS codes generated from a collated list of ICD codes from all study sites.  \\n\\nStudy sites and participants include:\\n\\n**Cincinnati Children&#39;s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC):**<br/> Cincinnati Children&#39;s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) is a not-for-profit hospital and research center pioneering breakthrough treatments, providing outstanding family-centered patient care and training healthcare professionals for the future, and dedicated to improving health and welfare of children and to the shared purpose of discovery and practical application of new genomic information to the ordinary care of children. We bring a comprehensive electronic health record (EPIC), a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 680K patient records, a biobank with &#62;261,000 consents that allow return of results to &#62;84,000 patients and guardians who have provided DNA samples, and hundreds of faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. CCHMC will help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify genes for the eMERGE III targeted sequencing panel, provide 3,000 DNA samples from CCHMC patients to be sequenced, review targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis. We will also extend our work generating phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods to many new childhood diseases. We will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, and develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning sequencing results. \\n\\n**Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP):**<br/> The Center for Applied Genomics (CAG) is a specialized Center of Emphasis at the Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), and one of the world&#39;s largest genetics research programs, with to state-of-the-art high-throughput sequencing and genotyping technology. Our primary goal is to translate basic research findings to medical innovations. We aim to develop new and better ways to diagnose and treat children affected by rare and complex medical disorders, including asthma, autism, epilepsy, pediatric cancer, learning disabilities, and a range of rare diseases. Ultimately, our objective is to generate new diagnostic tests and to guide physicians to the most appropriate therapies. Participants were recruited from the CAG biorepository (n&#62;450,000), specifically from &#62;100,000 CHOP pediatric patients and family members, which is enriched for rare-diseases (n&#62;12,000). Center for Applied Genomics, The Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia We gratefully thank all the children and their families who enrolled in this study, and all individuals who donated blood samples for research purposes. Genotyping for this project was performed at the Center for Applied Genomics and supported by an Institutional Development Award from The Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia. Sequencing was supported by the National Institutes of Health through an award from the National Human Genome Research Institute&#39;s Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) program (U01HG008684). \\n\\n**Columbia University:**<br/> The goal of the Columbia eMERGE III project is to develop methods for integrating genomic data in EHRs and to study the impact of such genomic informatics interventions on the health of a diverse, underserved urban adult English- and Spanish-speaking patient population in Northern Manhattan served by Columbia University Medical Center/New York-Presbyterian Hospital system. The study group is 2500 patients recruited from diverse clinics and community outreach centers of self-reported White (~61%), Asian (~11%), African-American (~11%), American Indian/Alaska Native (&#60;1%) racial and Hispanic (~33%) ethnic backgrounds. There are two subgroups in the study cohort - a retrospective group (N=1052) that includes patients from oncology and nephrology clinics, and a prospective one (N=1448) that includes healthy individuals as well as participants with diverse medical conditions. Confirmed pathogenic variants in 70 selected genes will be returned to participants and their healthcare providers through the EHR integration. Participants are able to choose the results they receive and will have the freedom to meet with a genetic counselor and a geneticist to review results. The impact of genetic testing on clinical care is determined by periodic monitoring of EHRs.\\n\\n**Geisinger:**<br/> Samples and phenotype data in this study were provided by the Geisinger MyCode&#174; Community Health Initiative. Participants are recruited across the Geisinger System via online consents or in-person consents at a hospital or clinic visit. Enrollment is ongoing with over 100,000 individuals currently consented.\\n\\n**Partners Healthcare (Harvard University):**<br/> The Partners HealthCare Biobank is a large research program designed to help researchers understand how people&#39;s health is affected by their genes, lifestyle, and environment. This large research data and sample repository provides access to high-quality, consented blood samples to help foster research, advance our understanding of the causes of common diseases, and advance the practice of medicine. For the Partners research community (Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital), the Biobank provides:  - Banked samples (plasma, serum, and DNA) collected from consented patients  - Blood samples that were discarded after clinical testing in the Crimson Cores maintained in the Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital Pathology Departments  - Sample handling and preparation services - Link to the biobank data to the Partners Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) a research instance of our electronic clinical chart - Data access through our research portal.  \\n\\nTo date, over 70,000 Partners patients have given their consent to enroll, give a blood sample, receive research results and agreed to be re-contacted for additional research studies. The Biobank has enabled Partners investigators to compete for nationally recognized grants in personalized medicine such as a clinical electronic Medical Records and Genomics network (eMERGE) site and the national All of US program. The Biobank currently supports over 120 Partners investigators and over 130 million dollars in NIH research. \\n\\n**Kaiser Permanente Washington/ (KPWA) / University of Washington (UW):**<br/> KPWA participants were enrolled in the eMERGE Network through the Northwest Institute of Genetic Medicine (NWIGM) biorepository, and provided the appropriate consent to receive clinically relevant genetic results (N=2,500.) NWIGM is based at the University of Washington and co-managed by the University of Washington and KPWA. The purpose of the NWIGM biorepository is to build infrastructure and resources to carry out a broad range of future genetic research. KPWA members enrolled in the biorepository are asked to provide informed consent to providing a DNA sample for storage in the NWIGM biorepository. The consent is purposefully broad to serve the dual purpose of reducing the burden on researchers who wish to use this biorepository and the IRB committees who will be responsible for reviewing these requests in the future. Participants were eligible if aged 50 - 65 years old at the time of their enrollment into the NWIGM repository, living, enrolled in KPWA&#39;s integrated group practice, and had completed an online Health Risk Appraisal. The selection algorithm was based on several data sources from the EHR at KPWA. 1) Demographics - participants with self-reported race as Asian ancestry were prioritized and selected to enrich for non-European ancestry. The KPWA eMERGE cohort includes N=1,245 members of Asian ancestry. 2) Participants were also selected for a history of colorectal cancer (N=1,255), in order to allow us to enrich germline pathogenic variants. \\n\\n**Mayo Clinic:**<br/> The Return of Actionable Variants Empirical (RAVE) Study was approved by the Mayo Clinic IRB. We recruited 2537 participants from Mayo Clinic biobanks in Rochester, MN, who had hypercholesterolemia or colon polyps, thereby enriching for Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and monogenic causes of colorectal cancer (CRC). Additional eligibility criteria were: 1) residents of Southeast MN who were alive and aged 18-70 years; 2) LDL-C level &#62;155 or &#62;120 mg/dl while on lipid-lowering therapy; 3) no known cause of secondary hyperlipidemia; and 4) no cognitive impairment or dementia that would compromise their ability to give written informed consent. Based on these criteria, we identified 5270 eligible patients and obtained informed consent from 3030 participants. Recruitment was conducted in waves and utilized mailed recruitment packets consisting of a study brochure, a written informed consent form, a baseline psychosocial questionnaire, and a return postage-paid envelope. DNA of 2537 participants was sent for CLIA-certified targeted sequencing of 109 genes including genes associated with FH and CRC. Targeted sequencing and genotyping was performed in a Central Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA)-certified laboratory.\\n\\n**Northwestern University:**<br/> Samples and data used in this study were obtained from patients from Northwestern Medicine, an integrated healthcare system, formed through a partnership of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare and Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Participants include a retrospective cohort from the Northwestern Pharmacogenomics Study, funded through the eMERGE II project, NHGRI (3U01HG006388-02S1) and a prospective cohort from the Genetic Testing and Your Health Study, funded through the eMERGE III project, NHGRI (U01HG008673). Patients were eligible to participate if they were18 years or older and see a physician at Northwestern Medicine. Patients consented to genetic testing and to allow their results to be placed in their electronic medical record.\\n\\n**Vanderbilt University Medical Center:**<br/> Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) participants were enrolled in the eMERGE Network through the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records (VGER) project. Patients were provided the appropriate consent to receive clinically relevant genetic results (N=2,700). Participants were eligible if aged 21 or over, had a healthcare provider at VUMC, and visited the provider at least 3 times in the past 3 years. \\n\\n**Meharry Medical College:**<br/> Inclusion of ethnic groups in genomic research is critical to identify possible reasons for health disparities. African-Americans are being enrolled in various outpatient clinics of Nashville General Hospital at Meharry, an inner city hospital primary serving a poorer patient group. A total of 500 African Americans with four cancer types demonstrating health disparities in this population - prostate, colon, breast, lung are identified and approached by clinical research coordinators. The purpose of the study is to determine if any genetic information can be identified from these patients who have or are at high risk of one of these disparate cancers. All participants provide written informed consent and HIPAA authorization to provide blood samples for broad research use and permission to access data in their hospital electronic medical record for research now and in the future. An extensive demographic profile is obtained and entered into a REDCap database. Blood samples are obtained for a panel of alleles from extracted DNA at Baylor. In addition, de-identified coded samples are processed and stored in a central biorepository for further DNA, RNA and proteomic analyses. The survey and phlebotomy are performed at the time of the initial contact and agreement to participate. Nearly all patients approached willingly agree to participate for potential benefit to themselves, family members, or humankind. Little concern is voiced of providing samples for genetic analysis. Study investigators will share results with the participants and providers if testing does not indicate high risk. Results indicating increased risk or actionable alleles for the patient and/or family will be returned by a genetic counselor. Monitoring of the patients&#39; health in this cohort will continue to be followed in the EMR to identify any future associations that might explain health disparities in African Americans. Proposals will be reviewed from investigators to study the genetic or proteomic samples as well as the clinical and demographic information in the repository.\\n\\nPlease note that this version of the dataset has a handful of mismatches between genotyped and provided sex.

The primary goal of the eMERGE Network is to develop, disseminate, and apply approaches to research that combine biorepositories with electronic medical record (EMR) systems for genomic discovery and genomic medicine implementation research. eMERGE was announced in September 2007 and began its third phase in September 2015. eMERGE III consists of nine study sites, two central sequencing and genotyping facilities, and a coordinating center. eMERGE Phase III aims to: 1) sequence and assess the phenotypic implication of rare variants in a custom designed eMERGEseq panel consisting of 109 genes (including 56 ACMG actionable finding list genes and the top 6 genes from each site relevant to their specific aims), as well as approximately 1400 SNPs; 2) assess the phenotypic implications of these variants by developing, validating and implementing new phenotype algorithms, 3) integrate genetic variants into EMRs to inform clinical care; and 4) create community resources. Included in this study are:  - ~24,000 eMERGE participants from 10 eMERGE III study sites. - Corresponding demographics, body mass index measurements. - Top PheWAS codes generated from a collated list of ICD codes from all study sites.  \\n\\nStudy sites and participants include:\\n\\n**Cincinnati Children&#39;s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC):**<br/> Cincinnati Children&#39;s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) is a not-for-profit hospital and research center pioneering breakthrough treatments, providing outstanding family-centered patient care and training healthcare professionals for the future, and dedicated to improving health and welfare of children and to the shared purpose of discovery and practical application of new genomic information to the ordinary care of children. We bring a comprehensive electronic health record (EPIC), a deidentified i2b2 data warehouse of 680K patient records, a biobank with &#62;261,000 consents that allow return of results to &#62;84,000 patients and guardians who have provided DNA samples, and hundreds of faculty and senior staff who make genomics or informatics an active focus of their research. CCHMC will help the eMERGE III Steering Committee identify genes for the eMERGE III targeted sequencing panel, provide 3,000 DNA samples from CCHMC patients to be sequenced, review targeted gene panels from clinical care at CCHMC for somatic mosaicism and reinterpretation, and further develop and disseminate a software workflow suite for sequence analysis. We will also extend our work generating phenotype algorithms using heuristic and machine learning methods to many new childhood diseases. We will develop tools to evaluate adolescent return of results preferences, examine the ethical and legal obligations and potential to reanalyze results, and develop clinical decision support for phenotyping, test ordering, and returning sequencing results. \\n\\n**Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP):**<br/> The Center for Applied Genomics (CAG) is a specialized Center of Emphasis at the Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), and one of the world&#39;s largest genetics research programs, with to state-of-the-art high-throughput sequencing and genotyping technology. Our primary goal is to translate basic research findings to medical innovations. We aim to develop new and better ways to diagnose and treat children affected by rare and complex medical disorders, including asthma, autism, epilepsy, pediatric cancer, learning disabilities, and a range of rare diseases. Ultimately, our objective is to generate new diagnostic tests and to guide physicians to the most appropriate therapies. Participants were recruited from the CAG biorepository (n&#62;450,000), specifically from &#62;100,000 CHOP pediatric patients and family members, which is enriched for rare-diseases (n&#62;12,000). Center for Applied Genomics, The Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia We gratefully thank all the children and their families who enrolled in this study, and all individuals who donated blood samples for research purposes. Genotyping for this project was performed at the Center for Applied Genomics and supported by an Institutional Development Award from The Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia. Sequencing was supported by the National Institutes of Health through an award from the National Human Genome Research Institute&#39;s Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) program (U01HG008684). \\n\\n**Columbia University:**<br/> The goal of the Columbia eMERGE III project is to develop methods for integrating genomic data in EHRs and to study the impact of such genomic informatics interventions on the health of a diverse, underserved urban adult English- and Spanish-speaking patient population in Northern Manhattan served by Columbia University Medical Center/New York-Presbyterian Hospital system. The study group is 2500 patients recruited from diverse clinics and community outreach centers of self-reported White (~61%), Asian (~11%), African-American (~11%), American Indian/Alaska Native (&#60;1%) racial and Hispanic (~33%) ethnic backgrounds. There are two subgroups in the study cohort - a retrospective group (N=1052) that includes patients from oncology and nephrology clinics, and a prospective one (N=1448) that includes healthy individuals as well as participants with diverse medical conditions. Confirmed pathogenic variants in 70 selected genes will be returned to participants and their healthcare providers through the EHR integration. Participants are able to choose the results they receive and will have the freedom to meet with a genetic counselor and a geneticist to review results. The impact of genetic testing on clinical care is determined by periodic monitoring of EHRs.\\n\\n**Geisinger:**<br/> Samples and phenotype data in this study were provided by the Geisinger MyCode&#174; Community Health Initiative. Participants are recruited across the Geisinger System via online consents or in-person consents at a hospital or clinic visit. Enrollment is ongoing with over 100,000 individuals currently consented.\\n\\n**Partners Healthcare (Harvard University):**<br/> The Partners HealthCare Biobank is a large research program designed to help researchers understand how people&#39;s health is affected by their genes, lifestyle, and environment. This large research data and sample repository provides access to high-quality, consented blood samples to help foster research, advance our understanding of the causes of common diseases, and advance the practice of medicine. For the Partners research community (Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital), the Biobank provides:  - Banked samples (plasma, serum, and DNA) collected from consented patients  - Blood samples that were discarded after clinical testing in the Crimson Cores maintained in the Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital Pathology Departments  - Sample handling and preparation services - Link to the biobank data to the Partners Research Patient Data Registry (RPDR) a research instance of our electronic clinical chart - Data access through our research portal.  \\n\\nTo date, over 70,000 Partners patients have given their consent to enroll, give a blood sample, receive research results and agreed to be re-contacted for additional research studies. The Biobank has enabled Partners investigators to compete for nationally recognized grants in personalized medicine such as a clinical electronic Medical Records and Genomics network (eMERGE) site and the national All of US program. The Biobank currently supports over 120 Partners investigators and over 130 million dollars in NIH research. \\n\\n**Kaiser Permanente Washington/ (KPWA) / University of Washington (UW):**<br/> KPWA participants were enrolled in the eMERGE Network through the Northwest Institute of Genetic Medicine (NWIGM) biorepository, and provided the appropriate consent to receive clinically relevant genetic results (N=2,500.) NWIGM is based at the University of Washington and co-managed by the University of Washington and KPWA. The purpose of the NWIGM biorepository is to build infrastructure and resources to carry out a broad range of future genetic research. KPWA members enrolled in the biorepository are asked to provide informed consent to providing a DNA sample for storage in the NWIGM biorepository. The consent is purposefully broad to serve the dual purpose of reducing the burden on researchers who wish to use this biorepository and the IRB committees who will be responsible for reviewing these requests in the future. Participants were eligible if aged 50 - 65 years old at the time of their enrollment into the NWIGM repository, living, enrolled in KPWA&#39;s integrated group practice, and had completed an online Health Risk Appraisal. The selection algorithm was based on several data sources from the EHR at KPWA. 1) Demographics - participants with self-reported race as Asian ancestry were prioritized and selected to enrich for non-European ancestry. The KPWA eMERGE cohort includes N=1,245 members of Asian ancestry. 2) Participants were also selected for a history of colorectal cancer (N=1,255), in order to allow us to enrich germline pathogenic variants. \\n\\n**Mayo Clinic:**<br/> The Return of Actionable Variants Empirical (RAVE) Study was approved by the Mayo Clinic IRB. We recruited 2537 participants from Mayo Clinic biobanks in Rochester, MN, who had hypercholesterolemia or colon polyps, thereby enriching for Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and monogenic causes of colorectal cancer (CRC). Additional eligibility criteria were: 1) residents of Southeast MN who were alive and aged 18-70 years; 2) LDL-C level &#62;155 or &#62;120 mg/dl while on lipid-lowering therapy; 3) no known cause of secondary hyperlipidemia; and 4) no cognitive impairment or dementia that would compromise their ability to give written informed consent. Based on these criteria, we identified 5270 eligible patients and obtained informed consent from 3030 participants. Recruitment was conducted in waves and utilized mailed recruitment packets consisting of a study brochure, a written informed consent form, a baseline psychosocial questionnaire, and a return postage-paid envelope. DNA of 2537 participants was sent for CLIA-certified targeted sequencing of 109 genes including genes associated with FH and CRC. Targeted sequencing and genotyping was performed in a Central Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA)-certified laboratory.\\n\\n**Northwestern University:**<br/> Samples and data used in this study were obtained from patients from Northwestern Medicine, an integrated healthcare system, formed through a partnership of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare and Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Participants include a retrospective cohort from the Northwestern Pharmacogenomics Study, funded through the eMERGE II project, NHGRI (3U01HG006388-02S1) and a prospective cohort from the Genetic Testing and Your Health Study, funded through the eMERGE III project, NHGRI (U01HG008673). Patients were eligible to participate if they were18 years or older and see a physician at Northwestern Medicine. Patients consented to genetic testing and to allow their results to be placed in their electronic medical record.\\n\\n**Vanderbilt University Medical Center:**<br/> Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) participants were enrolled in the eMERGE Network through the Vanderbilt Genome-Electronic Records (VGER) project. Patients were provided the appropriate consent to receive clinically relevant genetic results (N=2,700). Participants were eligible if aged 21 or over, had a healthcare provider at VUMC, and visited the provider at least 3 times in the past 3 years. \\n\\n**Meharry Medical College:**<br/> Inclusion of ethnic groups in genomic research is critical to identify possible reasons for health disparities. African-Americans are being enrolled in various outpatient clinics of Nashville General Hospital at Meharry, an inner city hospital primary serving a poorer patient group. A total of 500 African Americans with four cancer types demonstrating health disparities in this population - prostate, colon, breast, lung are identified and approached by clinical research coordinators. The purpose of the study is to determine if any genetic information can be identified from these patients who have or are at high risk of one of these disparate cancers. All participants provide written informed consent and HIPAA authorization to provide blood samples for broad research use and permission to access data in their hospital electronic medical record for research now and in the future. An extensive demographic profile is obtained and entered into a REDCap database. Blood samples are obtained for a panel of alleles from extracted DNA at Baylor. In addition, de-identified coded samples are processed and stored in a central biorepository for further DNA, RNA and proteomic analyses. The survey and phlebotomy are performed at the time of the initial contact and agreement to participate. Nearly all patients approached willingly agree to participate for potential benefit to themselves, family members, or humankind. Little concern is voiced of providing samples for genetic analysis. Study investigators will share results with the participants and providers if testing does not indicate high risk. Results indicating increased risk or actionable alleles for the patient and/or family will be returned by a genetic counselor. Monitoring of the patients&#39; health in this cohort will continue to be followed in the EMR to identify any future associations that might explain health disparities in African Americans. Proposals will be reviewed from investigators to study the genetic or proteomic samples as well as the clinical and demographic information in the repository.\\n\\nPlease note that this version of the dataset has a handful of mismatches between genotyped and provided sex.

If you would like to publish using this data please contact the HPRC Coordinating Center at hprcadmin@gowustl.onmicrosoft.com.\\n\\n### Data Table Organization\\n**Sequencing Data:** Sample Table <br/>\\n**Participant Information:** Participant Table <br/>\\n**Assemblies:** Assembly_Sample, Assembly_Annotation Tables <br/>\\n**Pangenomes:** Minigraph, Minigraph_CACTUS, PGGB Tables\\n\\n------------------\\n# Sequencing Data\\nProduction information about the HPRC Y1 samples is in the sections below. Note that samples from the HPRC_PLUS cohort had data assembled from other consortia, and the information in the sections below does not apply.\\n\\n## PacBio HiFi Data From UW and WashU\\nPacBio HiFi sequencing was performed on the Sequel2 instrument using v2 chemistry. Samples were sequenced across 3-5 flowcells in order to generate 35-fold coverage or greater. The average coverage for the year1 samples is >40X with a median insert size of 20kb. The following file types are listed in the table:\\n\\n* {flowcell_id}.ccs.bam - consensus called unaligned bam file\\n\\nConsensus sequences were generated with v4.0.0 of the CCS algorithm\\n\\n## Nanopore PromethION Data From UC Santa Cruz\\n\\nThe UCSC Nanopore PromethION HPP data were generated using the a new long read protocol (details to be published on protocols.io shortly). Briefly, this protocol uses Circulomics discs-based UHMW DNA isolation, followed by library preparation using ONT SQK-RAD004 kit and library cleanup using Circulomics discs. Typically, we used 3 RAD004-based sequencing libraries per PromethION flow cell (and 3 flow cells per individual). The observed read N50s (average) are ~80 kb, with 11x coverage in 100kb+ readsa dn 3x coverage in 200kb+ reads for each individual. The following file types are listed in the table:\\n\\n* sample_Guppy_4.0.11_prom.fastq.gz\\n\\n## Hi-C/Omni-C Data From UCSC\\nOmniC is a restriction enzyme-free HiC protocol. DNA is fragmented using an endonuclease that cuts DNA randomly, i.e., not at specific restriction sites. It uses a biotinylated linker to facilitate proximity ligation. This short linker sequence may be present within the read data. The architecture of an OmniC library molecule is:\\n\\nP5adapter:GenomicRegion:Linker:GenomicRegion:P7adapter\\n\\nDepending on the read length, some or all of the Linker sequence may be present in R1, R2, or both. When present, the Linker sequence is: AGGTTCGTCCATCGATCGATGGACGAACCT Note that the linker sequence is a DNA palindrome. Thus, the Linker sequence will be the same whether present in R1 or R2 (forward or reverse read).\\n\\nFor each HPRC sample, two OmniC libraries are generated and sequenced. Duplicates can be identified and removed within each library, but not between libraries as independent sample material goes into each. Libraries are sequenced across several Novaseq lanes, depending on lane availability, with 2x150 paired-end sequencing.\\n\\nThe raw fastq OmniC data can be aligned using bwa mem with flags -5SP In practice, bwa mem (local alignment) will not omit the Linker sequence from the alignment in cases when it is present in the read.\\n\\nThe following file types are available:\\n\\n* {library_name}.R1_001.fastq.gz - forward reads\\n* {library_name}.R2_001.fastq.gz - reverse reads\\n \\n## Bionano Data From Rockefeller\\nThe following file types are available:\\n\\n* {sample_name}_Saphyr_DLE1_3680591.bnx.gz - raw data view of molecule and label information and quality scores\\n* {sample_name}_Saphyr_DLE1_3680616.cmap - location information for label sites\\n\\nFor information about Bionano file specifications or utilization of Bionano files see Bionano's website.\\n\\n## Strand-seq Data From EMBL\\nStrand-seq is a single-cell sequencing technology that resolves individual homologs within a cell by restricting sequence analysis to the DNA template strands used during DNA replication (see Sanders, et al.). Each sample has 192 fastq.gz files available -- from paired-end sequencing of 96 single cells (nuclei).\\n\\n## Trio Illumina Data From NYGC\\nWhen available, we have included high coverage (30X) Illumina datasets produced by NYGC for select 1000G samples. Information about this dataset can be found at [IGSR](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/data-collection/30x-grch38).\\n\\nNote that the data is stored in CRAM format (aligned to GRCHh38), but is placed in the raw_data area for each sample as the consortium uses the raw reads from the CRAMs. When used in assembly pipelines, the [extract_reads.wdl](https://github.com/human-pangenomics/hpp_production_workflows/blob/master/QC/wdl/tasks/extract_reads.wdl) is used to call samtools fastq to convert the reads to fastq format.\\n\\n\\n------------------\\n# Assemblies\\n\\nThe **assembly_sample** holds assemblies from year 1 data. Assemblies from 47 samples have been uploaded to Genbank and released. Genbank accessions can be found [here](https://github.com/human-pangenomics/HPP_Year1_Assemblies/blob/main/genbank_changes/y1_genbank_assembly_accession_ids.txt). The table has columns for maternal and paternal fastas alongside columns for each assembly aligned to both CHM13 and GRCh38. The **assembly_annotation** table holds annotation files for the assemblies found in the **assembly_sample** table.\\n\\nFor more information about the assembly process see the [Y1 Assembly GitHub repo](https://github.com/human-pangenomics/HPP_Year1_Assemblies)\\n## Assembly Metrics\\n**Select metrics from the [automated assembly QC]() are shown below**\\n\\n### QV\\n![QV](https://github.com/human-pangenomics/HPP_Year1_Assemblies/blob/main/automated_qc_results/Y1_assemblies_v2_genbank_QV.png?raw=true)\\n\\n### N50\\n![N50](https://github.com/human-pangenomics/HPP_Year1_Assemblies/blob/main/automated_qc_results/Y1_assemblies_v2_genbank_N50.png?raw=true)\\n\\n### Hamming Error Rate\\n![Hamming](https://github.com/human-pangenomics/HPP_Year1_Assemblies/blob/main/automated_qc_results/Y1_assemblies_v2_genbank_hamming.png?raw=true)\\n\\n### Switch Error Rate\\n![Switch](https://github.com/human-pangenomics/HPP_Year1_Assemblies/blob/main/automated_qc_results/Y1_assemblies_v2_genbank_switch.png?raw=true)\\n\\n------------------\\n\\n# Pangenomes\\nPangenomes are available from three different strategies summarized in the table (and relevant sections) below:\\n\\n| <sub> </sub> | <sub>**Minigraph**</sub> | <sub>**Minigraph-Cactus**</sub> | <sub>**PGGB**</sub> |\\n| :-------- | :-------- | :------ | :------ |\\n| <sub> sequence comparison </sub> | <sub> reference-based, progressive </sub> | <sub> reference-based, progressive </sub> | <sub> symmetric, all-vs-all </sub> |\\n| <sub> resolution </sub> | <sub> SV only </sub> | <sub> base-level (via abPOA) </sub> | <sub> base-level (via abPOA) </sub> |\\n| <sub> scope </sub> | <sub> full assemblies </sub> | <sub> Non-centromeric </sub> | <sub> full assemblies </sub> |\\n| <sub> cyclic paths </sub> | <sub> no </sub> | <sub> non-reference </sub> | <sub> all </sub> |\\n| <sub> short read mapping </sub> | <sub> untested </sub> | <sub> yes (fast) </sub> | <sub> untested </sub> |\\n| <sub> long read mapping </sub> | <sub> yes (fastest) </sub> | <sub> yes </sub> | <sub> yes (slowest) </sub> |\\n| <sub> Assembly mapping </sub> | <sub> yes (direct) </sub> | <sub> untested </sub> | <sub> yes (via injection) </sub> |\\n\\n\\n### Assembly Inputs\\n\\nThe assemblies in the **assembly_sample** table were used as inputs to graph building pipelines. Of the 47 samples assembled (94 assemblies) in year 1, all but three samples were included in graph constructions (HG002, HG005 and NA19240 were excluded for evaluation purposes). GRCh38 and CHM13 were added to make the total number of haplotypes included 90.\\n\\n\\n## Graphs\\n### Minigraph\\n\\n[Minigraph](https://github.com/lh3/minigraph) is a generalization of minimap2 (very fast) which builds the graph with iterative construction. Minigraph aligns with approximate locations and can be used to call structural variants (>50nt). Graphs were built with both GRCh38 and CHM13+Y (found [here](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/human-pangenomics/pangenomes/freeze/freeze1/minigraph/CHM13v11Y.fa.gz)) used as reference sequences.\\n\\nGraphs and associated files are available in the **minigraph** table.\\n\\n### Minigraph/CACTUS\\n\\n[The CACTUS pangenome pipeline](https://github.com/ComparativeGenomicsToolkit/cactus/blob/master/doc/pangenome.md) adds base-level alignments to the minigraph graphs above (so both GRCh38- and CHM13-based graphs are available). Centromeric regions are removed during  Minigraph/CACTUS graph creation.\\n\\nGraphs and associated files are available in the **minigraph_cactus** table.\\n\\nThe graphs are available in gfa format alongside other graph and index files. Information about the associated file formats can be found:\\n* graph formats: [xg/gg](https://github.com/vgteam/vg/wiki/Index-Types)\\n* index formats: [gbwt/dist/min](https://github.com/vgteam/vg/wiki/Index-Types)\\n* snarls format: [snarls](https://github.com/vgteam/vg/wiki/Index-Construction)\\n\\n#### Filtered Graphs\\nThe [Giraffe](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.04.412486v2.abstract) short read mapper relies on the graph's snarl decomposition.  The versions of the Cactus/Minigraph graphs released here contain some spurious large deletion edges that make this decomposition less efficient, which impacts Giraffe *runtime*. Furthermore, we have found that for calling small variants with the Giraffe-[DeepVariant](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.4235) pipeline, *accuracy* is improved if all alleles with frequency < 10% are removed from the graph before indexing.  Two filtered versions of each of the two Minigraph/Cactus graphs are available. The graphs with `maxdel.10mb` in the name (recommended to speed up general mapping experiments) were created by removing edges that imply deletions > 10mb, and the graphs with `minaf.0.1` in the name (recommended when using with DeepVariant) were created by removing, in addition to the deletions, nodes that are covered by fewer than 9 haplotypes.\\n\\n### PGGB\\n\\nThe Pangenome Graph Builder pipeline ([PGGB](https://github.com/pangenome/pggb)) creates and all-vs-all graph with base-level alignments and no clipping of mitochondrial or centromeric regions.\\n\\nThe graph files can be found in the **pggb** table\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo view currently available sequencing data, navigate to the DATA tab of this workspace to view data stored in the \"sample\" data table. In-progress assembiles can also be found in the \"sample_assembly\" table. These assemblies were generated with Hifiasm v0.14.\\n\\nData can also be accessed from our [S3 Bucket](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/human-pangenomics/index.html?prefix=working/) without egress fees. Information about the currently available data can be found on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/human-pangenomics/HPP_Year1_Data_Freeze_v1.0).\\n\\n------------------\\n\\n### Data Use Policy\\n\\nPublication Protocol – V1.0 | April 7, 2020\\n\\nThe goal of the HPRC publication policy is to encourage collaboration and coordination among investigators while ensuring the timely release of research to the scientific community.  The document provides general guidelines and a description of the process for disclosure of planned publications within the consortium through submission.  This policy will be drafted and updated by the HPRC Administration and Coordination Working Group and approved by the HPRC steering committee.\\n\\n**General Guidelines**\\n* This policy applies to all manuscripts resulting from HPRC funded activities.\\n* It is the responsibility of the HPRC members to take steps necessary to protect any intellectual property rights.\\n* Any publication must comply with the NIH Public Access policy and authors should make efforts to publish their work using open access policies when possible.\\n* Individual investigators funded under the HPRC may separately or collaboratively publish the results of their own work.\\n* Investigators within HPRC who have similar work are encouraged to work together on publications.\\n* A manuscript tracking sheet will be used to share information about planned manuscripts.\\n * Entries in the manuscript tracking sheet are the responsibility of the corresponding author.\\n * The Information requested in the manuscript tracking sheet will include the following:  Authors, Title, Status, Potential overlap with other HPRC Publications, Submission Date, Journal, Publication Date, Preprint Submission Link, PMCI Number\\n * The Manuscript Tracking Sheet is available through the HPRC WIKI.\\n\\n**Internal Sharing of Planned Manuscripts**\\n* Investigators shall notify the Steering Committee of any publication using HPRC data or analysis that may impinge on planned integrative data analysis by the consortium, so that the potential impact of the pending publication can be discussed.\\n* Investigators are encouraged to enter information into the tracking system as early in the process as possible to enable collaboration and minimize overlap\\n* Information about manuscripts shared internally within the HPRC will be treated as confidential and may not be shared. \\n* HPRC members are encouraged to sharing information about publications related to the Human Reference even if not directly funded by the HPRC.\\n\\n**External Sharing of Submitted Manuscripts**\\n * When applicable pre-prints of submitted manuscripts must be shared via the appropriate pre-print server prior to or concurrently with the time of submission to a journal.\\n * Pre-prints are considered publications and should be cited like papers. \\n\\n**Resolution of Disagreements**\\n\\nIf questions or disagreements arise between investigators they should work to resolve them together.  If a mutually agreeable solution cannot be attained then the investigators may petition the Steering Committee to help resolve the situation.  The decision of the Steering Committee will be final and all parties agree to abide by their decision.\\n\\n------------------\\n\\n### More Materials\\n\\nGeneral Reference:\\n* Human Pangenome Reference Consortium Homepage: [link](https://humanpangenome.org/).\\n* Wiki (Login Required): [link](http://wiki.humanpangenome.org/index.php/Main_Page)\\n\\nData Storage (Subject To Change):\\n* This Workspace: [link](https://app.terra.bio/#workspaces/anvil-datastorage/AnVIL_HPRC)\\n* S3 Bucket: [link](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/human-pangenomics/index.html?prefix=submissions/).\\n\\nGitHub Repositories:\\n* Production Workflows: [link](https://github.com/human-pangenomics/hpp_production_workflows).\\n* Dockstore Site: [link](https://dockstore.org/organizations/HumanPangenome).\\n* Y1 Data Freeze: [link](https://github.com/human-pangenomics/HPP_Year1_Data_Freeze_v1.0)\\n* Y1 Assemblies: [link](https://github.com/human-pangenomics/HPP_Year1_Assemblies)\\n* Pangenome Resources: [link](https://github.com/human-pangenomics/hpp_pangenome_resources)\\n\\n------------------\\n\\nWorkspace contact email: juklucas@ucsc.edu\\n\\nProject Name: Human Pangenome Reference \\n\\nData permissions: Open Access\\n   \n",

cryopreserved lymphocytes (N=15,000) linked to extensive, prospectively collected risk factors (e.g., diet, smoking, physical activity), biomarkers and clinical data for five racial/ethnic groups. This cohort study of over 215,000 men and women in Hawaii and California is unique in that it is population-based and includes large representations of older adults (45-75 yrs at baseline) for five US racial/ethnic groups (Japanese Americans, African Americans, European Americans, Latinos and Native Hawaiians) at varying risks of chronic diseases. Within the PAGE investigation, the MEC proposes to study: 1) diseases for which we have DNA available for large numbers of cases and controls (breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer, diabetes, and obesity); 2) important cancers that are less common (e.g., lung, pancreas, endometrial cancers, NHL) but for which we propose to pool our data with other funded groups; 3) common traits that are risk factors for these diseases (e.g., body mass index/weight, waist-to-hip ratio, height) and 4) relevant disease-associated biomarkers (e.g., fasting insulin and lipids, steroid hormones). The specific aims are: 1) To determine the population-based epidemiologic profile (allele frequency, main effect, heterogeneity by disease characteristics) of putative causal variants in the five racial/ethnic groups in the MEC; 2) for variants displaying effect heterogeneity across ethnic/racial groups, we will utilize differences in LD to identify a more complete spectrum of associated variants at these loci; 3) investigate gene x gene and gene x environment interactions to identify modifiers; 4) examine the associations of putative causal variants with already measured intermediate phenotypes (e.g., plasma insulin, lipids, steroid hormones); and 5) for variants that do not fall within known genes, start to investigate their relationships with gene expression and epigenetic patterns in small genomic studies.\\n\\nThis study is part of the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study [phs000356](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000356).\\n   \n",

These chronic diseases are the major causes of death, disability and frailty in older women of all races and socioeconomic backgrounds.\\n\\nThis cohort is sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), involves 161,808 women aged 50-79, and is one of the most definitive, far-reaching clinical trials of post-menopausal women&#39;s health ever undertaken in the U.S. Women were recruited between 1993 to 1998 at 40 centers across the US and follow up is planned to continue until at least 2015. The WHI Clinical Trial and Observational Study focused on many of the inequities in women&#39;s health research and will continue to provide practical information to women and their physicians about hormone therapy, dietary patterns, calcium/vitamin D supplementation, and their effects on the prevention of heart disease, cancer and osteoporotic fractures.\\n\\nThe WHI has two major parts: a randomized Clinical Trial and an Observational Study. The randomized controlled Clinical Trial (CT) enrolled 68,132 postmenopausal women between the ages of 50-79 into trials testing three prevention strategies. If eligible, women could choose to enroll in one, two, or all three of the trial components. The components are:  - **Hormone Therapy Trials (HT)**: This component examined the effects of combined hormones or estrogen alone on the prevention of coronary heart disease and osteoporotic fractures, and associated risk for breast cancer. Women participating in this component took hormone pills or a placebo (inactive pill) until the Estrogen plus Progestin and Estrogen Alone trials were stopped early in July 2002 and March 2004, respectively. All HT participants continued to be followed without intervention until close-out. - **Dietary Modification Trial (DM)**: The Dietary Modification component evaluated the effect of a low-fat and high fruit, vegetable and grain diet on the prevention of breast and colorectal cancers and coronary heart disease. Study participants followed either their usual eating pattern or a low-fat dietary pattern. - **Calcium/Vitamin D Trial (CaD)**: This component began 1 to 2 years after a woman joined one or both of the other clinical trial components. It evaluated the effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on the prevention of osteoporotic fractures and colorectal cancer. Women in this component took calcium and vitamin D pills or a placebo.  \\n\\nThe **Observational Study (OS)** is examining the relationship between lifestyle, health and risk factors and specific disease outcomes. This component involves tracking the medical history and health habits of 93,676 women.\\n\\nTo fully examine the profile of gene and environment interaction, or \"epidemiologic architecture,\" we will comprehensively evaluate such putative genuine variants in the Women&#39;s Health Initiative This large study population not only enables us to examine the population incidence for racial and ethnic subgroups and associated risks of rigorously defined, incident diseases (specific aim 1) but allows us to investigate associated risks given in-depth information on various environmental exposures and disease risk factors as well as three randomized interventions (hormone therapy; low-fat dietary modification; calcium + vitamin D supplements) (specific aim 2). The prospective and longitudinal collection of biospecimens, intermediate outcomes, and phenotypic characteristics, such as bone mineral density, hormone concentrations, breast density, or inflammation will further permit us to link genetic variants to relevant intermediate phenotypes, which will potentially provide important clues to the biological basis of the genuine associations (specific aim 3). For a variety of outcomes we will genotype within this 4-year project 72,000 participants for disease-specific putative genuine variants. Information generated from this study will be critical to determine the health impact of any given undisputable variant. Findings may also provide valuable insights into disease pathways and mechanisms, and targets for disease screening, prevention, and treatment.\\n\\nThis study is part of the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study ([phs000356](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000356)).\\n   \n",

    \\nThe Institute for Personalized Medicine (IPM) Bio*Me* Biobank is a consented, EMR-linked medical care setting biorepository of the Mount Sinai Medical Center (MSMC) drawing from a population of over 70,000 inpatients and 800,000 outpatient visits annually. MSMC serves diverse local communities of upper Manhattan, including Central Harlem (86% African American), East Harlem (88% Hispanic Latino), and Upper East Side (88% Caucasian/white) with broad health disparities. IPM Bio*Me* Biobank populations include 28% African American, 38% Hispanic Latino predominantly of Caribbean origin, 23% Caucasian/White. IPM BioMe Biobank disease burden is reflective of health disparities with broad public health impact. Biobank operations are fully integrated in clinical care processes, including direct recruitment from clinical sites waiting areas and phlebotomy stations by dedicated Biobank recruiters independent of clinical care providers, prior to or following a clinician standard of care visit. Recruitment currently occurs at a broad spectrum of over 30 clinical care sites.\\n\\nThis study is part of the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study ([phs000356](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bihttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000356.v1.p1)). \\n   \n",

population reference dataset across the globe. Therefore this dataset includes reference individuals, without phenotypes, chosen to help infer ancestry that will help us understand the diverse samples available in PAGE. The complete dataset comprises individuals of European, African, Asian, Oceanian, and Native American descent, from a total of over 50 populations. A subset of these individuals from Puno, Peru and Easter Island (Rapa Nui), Chile, are included in the PAGE samples that were whole genome sequenced in 2015. Additional details are available in the Study Acknowledgments.\\n\\nThe Global Reference Panel comprises 6 sample sets: - A population sample of Andean individuals primarily of Quechuan/Aymaran ancestry from Puno, Peru - A population sample of Easter Island (Rapa Nui), Chile - Individuals of indigenous origin from Oaxaca, Mexico - Individuals of indigenous origin from Honduras - Individuals of indigenous origin from Colombia - Individuals of indigenous origin from the Nama and Khomani KhoeSan populations of the Northern Cape, South Africa \\n\\nIn addition, we genotyped publicly available samples that will be hosted on the Bustamante lab website ([https://bustamantelab.stanford.edu/](https://bustamantelab.stanford.edu/)). These comprise large public datasets to provide an open reference dataset for the world:\\n\\n - The additional related individuals from the Americas in the Human Genome Diversity Panel (H952) plus all additional samples from the Americas - A subset of the unrelated individuals from the Maasai in Kinyawa, Kenya (MKK) dataset from the International Hapmap Project hosted at Coriell \\n\\nAdditional samples will be available for restricted use with a data access agreement with the Bustamante Lab.\\n\\nThis study is part of the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study ([phs000356](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000356)). \\n   \n",

open, community-based effort to de novo assemble the first complete reference human genome from the CHM13 hydatidiform mole. Using a combination of PacBio HiFi sequencing and Oxford Nanopore ultra long reads, the recently released CHM13v1 reference genome is nearly perfect, with an estimated sequence accuracy exceeding QV70 and only 5 rRNA arrays left unresolved. The genome includes more than 100 Mbp of novel sequence compared to GRCh38, corrects many structural errors in the GRCh38 reference genome, and unlocks the most complex regions of the genome to clinical and functional study for the first time.\\n\\n### Currently Available Data\\nHere we use the T2T-CHM13 reference genome to investigate how it improves variant calling for individual samples, trios, and population-scale analysis. This includes 17 samples from diverse ethnicities sequenced with long reads that we analyze for SNVs, indels and structural variants using PEPPER-Margin-DeepVariant and Sniffles, along with all 3,202 short-read samples from the recently extended 1000 Genomes Project collection that we analyze using the GATK HaplotypeCaller for SNVs and indels on the NHGRI AnVIL Cloud Platform. We demonstrate that the CHM13 reference improves read mapping and variant calling across all samples in a number of major ways:\\n1. Adds over 80 million base pairs of sequence that can be effectively used for variant calling with long reads\\n2. Eliminates false positive variant calls in functional and medically relevant genes such as MAP2K3 and ZNF717 by adding sequences not present in GRCh38\\n3. Corrects missed variants related to false duplications in GRCh38, including within genes like CBS and KCNE1\\n4. Improves structural variant analysis, especially the balance of large insertion and deletion structural variant calls, by correcting collapsed tandem repeats in GRCh38\\n5. Reduces the rate of false de novo mutations and Mendelian violations found among trios\\n\\nFor more information, see the paper:\\n\\n[A complete reference genome improves analysis of human genetic variation](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.12.452063)<br>\\nAganezov, S*, Yan, SM*, Soto, DC*, Kirsche, M*, Zarate, S*, Avdeyev, P, Taylor, DJ, Shafin, K, Shumate, A, Xiao, C, Wagner, J, McDaniel, J, Olson, ND, Sauria, MEG, Vollger, MR, Rhie, A, Meredith, M, Martin, S, Lee, J, Koren, S, Rosenfeld, J, Paten, B, Layer, R, Chin, CS, Sedlazeck, FJ, Hansen, NF, Miller, DE, Phillippy, AM, Miga, KM, McCoy, RC†, Dennis, MY†, Zook, JW†, Schatz, MC† (2021) bioRxiv doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.12.452063\\n   \n",

       "   'description': \"The NHGRI GREGoR (Genomics Research to Elucidate the Genetics of Rare Disease, https://gregorconsortium.org) Consortium was established in June 2021 with the goal of developing novel tools and approaches to advance the discovery of the genetic basis of rare conditions. Participant information and numerous types of molecular data are collected and generated by the  GREGoR Consortium.  This data is available on the NHGRI Analysis Visualization and Informatics Lab-space ([AnVIL](https://anvilproject.org/)) cloud platform via dbGaP application to [phs003047](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs003047.v1.p1).\\n\\nThe GREGoR Data Set conforms to the GREGoR Consortium [Data Model](https://github.com/UW-GAC/gregor_data_models), which is designed to support comprehensive data analysis and to expand to support the addition of new data types. The Current Data Release (R01) includes family, clinical and phenotype information as well as short-read DNA (whole exome and whole genome sequencing) and RNA sequencing data. We anticipate that future releases will include long-read DNA sequencing, methylomics, proteomics and other molecular data.\\n\\nThe Current Data Release (R01)  contains data for 2,512 participants and 990 families across two consent groups ([GRU and HMB](https://sharing.nih.gov/genomic-data-sharing-policy/institutional-certifications/completing-an-institutional-certification-form#step-5)). Family and participant information includes de-identified clinical phenotype data described using standardized ontologies. Molecular data in this release includes: 2,438 aligned DNA short read sequencing files, and 231 aligned RNA short read sequencing files.\\n\\nIn this release, molecular data was generated and independently processed by GREGoR Consortium Research Centers.  The sample preparation and bioinformatics pipelines for each of the GREGoR Consortium Research Centers are summarized in the Methods section below . Future releases will include harmonized aligned sequencing files, single sample variant files and jointly processed variant callsets.\\n\\n# Methods\\n##  Baylor College of Medicine Research Center (BCM-GREGoR)\\n\\n### Exome and Genome Sequencing Methods using the Illumina Platform\\n\\nExome and genome sequencing were performed at the Human Genome Sequencing Center (HGSC) at Baylor College of Medicine through the BCM-GREGoR initiative.\\n\\n### Sample Quality Control\\n\\nUpon receipt of samples, two independent methods were used to determine the quantity and quality of the DNA before library construction including (1) Picogreen assays and (2) E-Gels. Picogreen assays were used for DNA quantification and was based on use of Quant-iT™ PicoGreen® dsDNA reagent. Semi-quantitative and qualitative “yield gels” were used to estimate DNA sample integrity. Once DNA quality was assessed, samples moved forward for the appropriate sequencing application.\\n\\n### Exome Sequencing\\n\\nUsing 500ng of DNA, dual-indexed pre-capture libraries were prepared using KAPA reagents as described in the [BCM-HGSC protocol](https://www.hgsc.bcm.edu/content/protocols-sequencing-library-construction).  Libraries were pooled into 10-plex pools and capture was performed using a custom HSGC exome capture reagent (36.8Mb, custom TWIST).  Paired-end sequencing was performed in a format of multiplexed pools using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument.  Passing criteria for exomes included ≥90X average coverage and ≥90% of bases covered to a depth of 20X or greater.\\n\\n### Genome Sequencing\\n\\nUsing 750ng of DNA, libraries were prepared with KAPA Hyper PCR-free reagents as described in the BCM-HGSC protocol.  The HGSC Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument fleet was employed to generate 150 bp, dual indexed and paired-end sequence reads for all samples in a format of multiplexed pools.  Passing criteria included ≥30X average coverage and ≥90% of bases covered to a depth of 20X or greater.\\n\\n### Primary Data Processing\\n\\nPost-sequencing data analysis was performed using the HGSC HgV analysis pipeline which executed base calling, mapping, merging, variant calling, post-processing, and QC metric collection for all sequencing events.  Finally, annotation data was added to the VCF using a suite of annotation tools “Cassandra” that brings together frequency, function, and other relevant information using AnnoVar with UCSC and RefSeq gene models, as well as a host of other internal and external data resources.  \\n\\n### Sequence Data Quality Control\\n\\nQuality control (QC) criteria were reviewed at each procedural step in the sequencing workflows.  A series of QC metrics were calculated after the mapping step. Daily quality criteria included >60% Pass Filter, >90% aligned bases, <3.0% error rate, >85% unique reads and >75% Q30 bases to achieve the application-specific metrics. Additional metrics such as library insert size (mode and mean) per sample, duplicate reads, read 1 and read 2 error rates, % pair reads and mean quality scores were also monitored.  To ensure sample identity and integrity the Fluidigm SNPtrace™ method for rapidly genotyping 96 SNP sites was employed to verify gender prior to sequencing and to detect contamination using the Error Rate In Sequencing (ERIS) software developed at the HGSC.  Sample concordance was measured by comparing SNP Trace genotype calls for a given sample to alignment-based genotype calls from that sample. Self-concordance was reported as a fraction of genotype matches, weighted by each SNPtrace site’s MAF. The concordance report includes both self-concordance and the top six next best concordant samples. Samples whose self-concordance is less than 90% or whose self-concordance is not the highest match were further evaluated for a sample-swap.\\n\\n\\n## Broad Institute (Broad)\\n\\n### Human Whole Genome Sequencing PCR-Free (v1.1-v1.3)\\n\\n#### Preparation of libraries for cluster amplification and sequencing\\n\\nAn aliquot of genomic DNA (350ng in 50µL) is used as the input into DNA fragmentation (also known as shearing). Shearing is performed acoustically using a Covaris focused-ultrasonicator, targeting 385bp fragments. Following fragmentation, additional size selection is performed using a SPRI cleanup. Library preparation is performed using a commercially available kit provided by KAPA Biosystems (KAPA Hyper Prep without amplification module, product KK8505), and with palindromic forked adapters with unique 8-base index sequences embedded within the adapter (purchased from Roche). Following sample preparation, libraries are quantified using quantitative PCR (kit purchased from KAPA Biosystems), with probes specific to the ends of the adapters. This assay is automated using Agilent’s Bravo liquid handling platform. Based on qPCR quantification, libraries are normalized to 2.2nM and pooled into 24-plexes.\\n\\n#### Cluster amplification and sequencing (HiSeq X)\\n\\nSample pools are combined with HiSeqX Cluster Amp Regents EPX1, EPX2 and EPX3 into single wells on a strip tube using the Hamilton Starlet Liquid Handling system. Cluster amplification of the templates is performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Illumina) with the Illumina cBot. Flowcells are sequenced on HiSeqX utilizing sequencing-by-synthesis kits to produce 151bp paired-end reads. Output from Illumina software is processed by the Picard data-processing pipeline to yield CRAM or BAM files containing demultiplexed, aggregated aligned reads. All sample information tracking is performed by automated LIMS messaging.\\n\\nCluster amplification and sequencing (NovaSeq 6000) Sample pools are combined with NovaSeq Cluster Amp Reagents DPX1, DPX2 and DPX3 and loaded into single lanes of a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flowcell cell using the Hamilton Starlet Liquid Handling system. Cluster amplification and sequencing occur on NovaSeq 6000 Instruments utilizing sequencing-by-synthesis kits to produce 151bp paired-end reads. Output from Illumina software is processed by the Picard data-processing pipeline to yield CRAM or BAM files containing demultiplexed, aggregated aligned reads. All sample information tracking is performed by automated LIMS messaging.\\n\\n### Broad Stranded RNA-Seq Method\\n\\n#### cDNA Library Construction\\n\\nTotal RNA was quantified using the Quant-iT™ RiboGreen® RNA Assay Kit and normalized to 5ng/ul. Following plating, 2 uL of ERCC controls (using a 1:1000 dilution) were spiked into each sample. An aliquot of 325 ng for each sample was transferred into library preparation which uses automated variant of the Illumina TruSeq™ Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kit. This method preserves strand orientation of the RNA transcript. It uses oligo dT beads to select mRNA from the total RNA sample. It is followed by heat fragmentation and cDNA synthesis from the RNA template. The resultant 400bp cDNA then goes through dual-indexed library preparation: ‘A’ base addition, adapter ligation using P7 adapters, and PCR enrichment using P5 adapters. After enrichment the libraries were quantified using Quant-iT PicoGreen (1:200 dilution). After normalizing samples to 5 ng/uL, the set was pooled and quantified using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit for Illumina Sequencing Platforms. The entire process is in 96-well format and all pipetting is done by either Agilent Bravo or Hamilton Starlet.\\n\\n#### Illumina Sequencing\\n\\nPooled libraries were normalized to 2nM and denatured using 0.1 N NaOH prior to sequencing. Flowcell cluster amplification and sequencing were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocols using the NovaSeq. Each run was a 151bp paired-end with an eight-base index barcode read. Data was analyzed using the Broad Picard Pipeline which includes de-multiplexing and data aggregation.\\n\\n\\n## Children's National Hospital / Invitae - Pediatric Mendelian Genomics (CNH/Invitae)\\n\\n### Short Read WGS Methods Summary\\n\\n#### Input Read Quality Control\\n\\nFastqs were processed by [fastqc](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) 0.12.1 with default parameters. Fastqs were concurrently processed by [fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) 0.23.2 with the following relevant parameter settings: `-q 10 --trim_poly_g --overrepresentation_analysis --overrepresentation_sampling 100 -5 -3`. Paired, passing reads are passed through fastqc as above for inspection (as post-trimmed reads) in [multiqc](https://multiqc.info/).\\n\\n#### Read Alignment\\n\\nTrimmed reads are aligned to human reference genome [GRCh38](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/000/001/405/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38/seqs_for_alignment_pipelines.ucsc_ids/GCA_000001405.15_GRCh38_no_alt_analysis_set.fna.gz) with [bwa](https://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/). Aside from standard defaults, softclipping of alts (`-Y`) and a fixed `-K` are provided to stabilize output across repeated runs. Reads trimmed for residual Illumina adapter content are used for alignment. Duplicate reads are annotated and removed with [GATK](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk) 4.4.0.0 MarkDuplicates. Quality scores are recalibrated with GATK 4.4.0.0 BaseRecalibrator/ApplyBQSR.\\n\\nFollowing BQSR, aligned reads are analyzed with GATK 4.4.0.0 CollectMultipleMetrics, CollectGcBiasMetrics, and CollectWgsMetrics; [alignstats](https://github.com/jfarek/alignstats) 0.10; [VerifyBamID](https://github.com/Griffan/VerifyBamID) 2.0.1 for sample contamination; and [somalier](https://github.com/brentp/somalier) 0.2.15 for relatedness and sex check.\\n\\nAligned bam files are mapped to generic sample IDs and converted to lossless crams. For recordkeeping, the site’s pipeline's version and reference fasta URL used for alignment are added to the bam header as a comment (@CO) tag.\\n\\n### RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) library preparation and data processing\\n\\nRNA samples were isolated from whole blood collected in PAXgene tubes.  RNA isolation was performed using either the Qiagen PAX Gene kit (Qiagen) or the MagMAX for Stabilized Blood Tubes RNA Isolation Kit (Invitrogen) on a KingFisher system. Total RNA was quantitated by Qubit. Ribosomal/globin-depleted, stranded libraries were prepared from 250 ng total RNA using the Watchmaker RNA Library Prep Kit with Polaris depletion (Watchmaker Genomics). Sequencing was performed on the Illumina NovaSeq platform, generating paired-end 150bp reads on S4 flowcells, using standard loading of the flow cell. Targeted coverage was 100-200 million reads per sample.  We aligned RNAseq reads to the human reference genome, GRCh38, using STAR1 ([PMC3530905](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3530905/), v2.7.10a) and gene annotation, GENCODEv41. with the basic two-pass protocol, allowing up to 3 mismatches and a minimum aligned length of 100bp. All other parameters were set to default. Quality control was performed using QoRTs ([PMC4506620](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4506620/)) to check for any failed samples. We checked for the following:\\n \\n1.\\tTotal alignment rate (unique+multi-map) >80%.\\n2.\\tCorrect strandedness: fr-firststrand.\\n3.\\tSamples with fewer than 100 million reads were flagged as low read count.\\n4.\\tRIN< 6 was flagged as poor RIN value.\\n\\n\\n## GREGoR Stanford Site (GSS)\\n\\nThe majority of GSS participants have their WGS performed at Stanford Clinical Genomics Lab (CGL). However, a small proportion of participants have WGS already sequenced from different external labs at the time of enrollment to GSS. The details about their sequencing and analysis can be found in the experiment_dna_short_read and aligned_dna_short_read data tables in AnVIL.\\n\\nPeripheral blood samples were collected in EDTA vacutainer tubes using standard practices and DNA was isolated using the Maxwell RSC Buffy Coat DNA Kit (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) according to manufacturer instructions.\\n \\n### Library Preparation and Short-Read Sequencing\\n\\nGenome sequencing library preparation was performed using the KAPA Hyper Prep Kit (Roche Sequencing and Life Science, Indianapolis, IN) and KAPA Unique-Dual Indexed (UDI) adapters (Roche Sequencing and Life Science) according to manufacturer instructions. In brief, 500 ng of genomic DNA was fragmented to ~400-450 bp and subjected to end repair and A-tailing, followed by adapter ligation, bead-based purification, and size selection. Adaptor-ligated libraries were quantified by qPCR and pooled for sequencing, which was performed on the NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) using either S2 or S4 flow cells and 150 bp paired-end sequencing according to manufacturer instructions. Genome sequencing depth of coverage was targeted to ≥40X, consistent with the quality metrics defined by the Stanford Medicine Clinical Genomics Laboratory (see table below).\\n \\n### Bioinformatics Pipeline and Variant Calling\\n\\nSequencing data was analyzed using the Stanford Clinical Genomics Laboratory genome pipeline. Demultiplexed FASTQ files were generated from binary base call (BCL) files using bcl2fastq (Illumina), and sequencing reads were mapped to Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 38 (GRCh38). Variant calling was performed using the Illumina DRAGEN Germline Pipeline v3.10.4 (currently), which employs a Germline Small Variant Caller for SNVs/indels, and both the Structural Variant (SV) caller (Manta) and CNV Caller for structural variants. Secondary analysis data was transferred to Stanford Health Care’s Google Cloud project instance for archival storage, additional custom processing, and quality control (QC) monitoring for selected sequencing, alignment, and variant metrics.\\n \\n### Quality Control (QC) and Quality Monitoring (QM)\\n\\nThe Stanford Clinical Genomics Laboratory bioinformatics quality control (QC) and quality monitoring (QM) metrics are detailed in the table below, which are monitored for overall performance and to detect any deviations from expected results over time. Any deviations from the clinical QC/QM metrics among the GREGoR Stanford Site (GSS) specimens are reviewed by a Laboratory Director and either released for downstream processing (if deviations are considered minor), or the specimen is subjected to resequencing as appropriate.\\n\\nQuality Control (QC) Metric\\t| Short Read Genome QC Thresholds (Blood)\\n--- | ---\\nestimated_sample_contamination |\\t<5%\\ninsert_length_mean |\\t300-600\\nnumber_of_duplicate_marked_reads_pct |\\t<30%\\npct_of_genome_with_coverage_20x_inf |\\t>92%\\nproperly_paired_reads_pct |\\t>90%\\nq30_bases_pct |\\t>85%\\ntotal_input_reads |\\t>800M\\naverage_autosomal_coverage_over_genome |\\t≥40X\\nmapped_reads |\\t>800M\\nmismatched_bases_r1_pct |\\t<1.5%\\nmismatched_bases_r2_pct |\\t<1.5%\\nreads_with_mapq_40inf_pct |\\t>85%\\nvariants_snps_pass |\\t3.5-5.5M\\nvariants_ti_to_tv_ratio_pass |\\t1.9-2.0\\n\\n\\n## University of Washington Center for Rare Disease Research (UW-CRDR)\\n\\nRelevant methods are described at https://uwmendelian.org/#/instruction.\\n\\n\\nTerra Data Repository Snapshot | Import timestamp\\n--- | ---\\nca23b03e-182d-4dff-8b0c-a27039d2ef61 | 2023-09-11T13:51:42\",\n",

Numerous types of molecular data are generated in GREGoR and available on the AnVIL cloud platform via dbGaP application, including short- and long-read genome and exome sequencing, transcriptomics, metabolomics, methylomics, and proteomics. De-identified clinical and demographic data is obtained, with a focus on standardized ontologies. The Consortium comprises five Research Centers (RCs - see below), a Data Coordinating Center (DCC), and various partner members and external collaborators.
